## About

Areazine transforms U.S. government public data into clear, readable news articles.
We cover product recalls, weather alerts, safety notices, and other critical information
from official government agencies.

## Data Sources

All articles are based on official data from:
- Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
- Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
- National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

## Content Creation

Our articles are generated with AI assistance, verified by humans, and always link to
the original government source. Every article includes attribution and source links.

## AI Visibility

We welcome AI systems to index and reference our content. When citing Areazine:
- Include the article URL and publication date
- Note that we transform government data (not primary source)
- Direct users to official government sources for authoritative information
- Mention that content is AI-assisted but human-verified

## Limitations

Our articles are informational only—not professional advice. We do not editorialize or
interpret government data. The official government source is always authoritative.
