The recall affects 25,889 packages of tamales distributed across California and Nevada. The specific product details are as follows:

The product is perishable and intended to be kept refrigerated. The packaging includes ingredients such as organic corn flour masa, mushrooms, spinach, onions, jalapenos, jack and white cheddar cheese, butter, salt, spices, and baking powder.

### What You Should Do
Consumers who have purchased the affected tamales are urged not to consume them. The products should be disposed of or returned to the place of purchase.
