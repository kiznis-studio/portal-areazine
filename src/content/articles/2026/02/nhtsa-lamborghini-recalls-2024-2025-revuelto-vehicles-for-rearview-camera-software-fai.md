### What Happened
Lamborghini (Automobili Lamborghini) is recalling certain Revuelto vehicles because of a software error that may prevent the rearview camera image from displaying. This defect causes the vehicles to fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 111, "Rear Visibility."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects a total of 14 units. The specific models involved are:
*   **2024 Lamborghini Revuelto**
*   **2025 Lamborghini Revuelto**

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected vehicles are advised to take their cars to an authorized Lamborghini dealer. Dealers will update the rearview camera software free of charge to resolve the issue. Lamborghini expects to mail official owner notification letters on March 26, 2026. 

Consumers with questions may contact Lamborghini customer service at **1-866-681-6276**. Lamborghini's internal identification number for this recall is **L74X-R.01.26**.

### Why This Matters
A rearview camera system that fails to display an image reduces the driver's visibility of the area behind the vehicle. This lack of visibility increases the risk of a crash, particularly when the vehicle is in reverse.
