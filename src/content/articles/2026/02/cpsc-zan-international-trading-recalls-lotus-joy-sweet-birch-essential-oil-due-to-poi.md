### What Happened
Zan International Trading has announced a recall of Lotus Joy Organic Sweet Birch Essential Oil bottles because the product contains methyl salicylate, which requires child-resistant packaging under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA). The current bottles are not child-resistant, posing a risk of serious injury or death if the contents are swallowed by young children. No injuries have been reported to date.

### Which Products Are Affected
This recall involves approximately 470 units of Lotus Joy Organic Sweet Birch Essential Oil. 

*   **Product Details**: 0.34 fluid ounce amber bottles with a black cap and a separate glass dropper with a black cap.
*   **Labeling**: The white label on the bottle features orange and black text with "LotusJoy," "organic," "sweet birch," "essential oil," and "betula lenta" on the front. 
*   **Packaging**: The product was sold in a blue box with matching orange and black lettering.
*   **Sales Information**: The items were sold online at Amazon.com from August 2025 through November 2025 for approximately $13.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately secure the recalled essential oil in a location out of the sight and reach of children. To receive a full refund, consumers are instructed to pour the contents of the bottle into the trash, take a photo of the bottle in the trash, and email the photo to Zan International Trading at zantradellc@hotmail.com.

For more information, consumers can contact Zan International Trading toll-free at 888-5739-288 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday, or via email at zantradellc@hotmail.com.

### Why This Matters
Substances containing methyl salicylate must be stored in child-resistant packaging to prevent accidental ingestion. The failure to meet these safety standards creates a significant poisoning risk that can lead to life-threatening consequences for young children.
