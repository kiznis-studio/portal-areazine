### What Happened
Forest River Bus, LLC has issued a recall for specific Trans Tech school buses due to concerns regarding vehicle weight distribution. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the modified seating floor plans in these vehicles may cause the weight to exceed the rear Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR). This defect means the vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 120, "Wheels and Rims - Other Than Passenger Cars."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall impacts a total of 134 units. The following models are included:
- **Make/Model**: Forest River Bus Trans Tech School Bus
- **Model Years**: 2025 and 2026
- **Recall Numbers**: NHTSA Campaign Number 26V014000; Forest River Bus internal number 05-2015

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected school buses are encouraged to contact Forest River Bus customer service at 1-800-348-7440. Authorized dealers will modify the seating configurations free of charge to ensure the vehicle remains within safe weight limits. Additionally, the manufacturer will provide a refund for any lost seating capacity necessitated by the modification. Owner notification letters are expected to be sent out by February 25, 2026.

### Why This Matters
Exceeding the rear axle weight rating is a serious safety concern. Overloading the rear axle can lead to a loss of vehicle control, which significantly increases the risk of a crash for the driver and passengers.
