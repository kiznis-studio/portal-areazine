### Alert Details
The National Weather Service (NWS) Juneau AK has issued a Storm Warning for specific coastal waters in Southeast Alaska. This alert follows a progression of hazardous marine conditions including a Small Craft Advisory and a Gale Warning currently in effect for the region.

### Affected Areas
The warning impacts the following offshore regions:

### What You Should Do
Mariners are strongly advised to remain in port.
