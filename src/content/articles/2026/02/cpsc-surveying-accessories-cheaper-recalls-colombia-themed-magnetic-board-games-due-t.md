### What Happened

Surveying Accessories Cheaper has announced a recall of its Colombia-themed magnetic board games because they violate the mandatory federal safety standard for toys. The game pieces contain loose, high-powered magnets that pose a significant ingestion hazard. If multiple magnets are swallowed, they can attract each other through intestinal tissues, leading to severe internal injuries or death.

### Which Products Are Affected

The recall affects approximately 1,200 units of the four- and six-player versions of the Colombia-themed magnetic board games. 

**Product Details:**
- **Description:** A two-sided board with a storage bag, 32 multi-colored magnetic pieces, and two dice in a storage pouch. 
- **Markings:** The board features the text "Colombia que linda eres," and the storage box is printed with "Cositas Colombianas."
- **Packaging:** The original packaging included a piece of chocolate.
- **Sales Information:** The games were sold for between $20 and $50 at Centro Envíos Aventura in Miami, Florida, and online at Amazon.com from April 2023 through June 2025.

### What You Should Do

Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled board games and ensure they are kept away from children. To receive a full refund, contact Surveying Accessories Cheaper to obtain a pre-paid shipping label to return the product. Refunds will be issued via the original form of payment or by check.

**Contact Information:**
- **Phone:** 305-336-6042 (Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET)
- **Email:** zlipgo.sales@gmail.com

### Why This Matters

When high-powered magnets are ingested, they can become lodged in the digestive system, causing intestinal perforations, twisting, blockages, blood poisoning, and death. While no injuries have been reported to date, the product fails to meet mandatory safety requirements designed to prevent these life-threatening outcomes.
