### What Happened
A minor earthquake with a magnitude of 3.7 ml occurred on Saturday, February 14, 2026, at 01:23 UTC. The seismic event was recorded at a very shallow depth of 5 kilometers. 

### Location Details
The epicenter was located approximately 115 km north of Yakutat, Alaska, at coordinates 60.5786°N and 139.9475°W. The depth of 5 km is categorized as shallow; earthquakes occurring at depths of less than 20 km are typically felt more distinctly at the surface than deeper events of similar magnitude.

### Impact Assessment
According to the USGS, there were no immediate reports of the earthquake being felt by the public. No tsunami advisory, watch, or warning was issued in connection with this event. The earthquake did not trigger a specific alert level color, and the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) was calculated at 4.261.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are classified as minor. While they are often felt by people in the immediate vicinity of the epicenter, they rarely cause damage to buildings or infrastructure. Residents in seismically active regions are reminded that aftershocks are a common occurrence following an initial event and are encouraged to follow standard safety protocols.
