### What Happened
Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC has issued a recall for certain 2020-2021 Jaguar I-PACE vehicles. The recall was initiated because the high voltage traction battery in these vehicles may overheat, which significantly increases the risk of a vehicle fire.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects a total of 4,556 units. Specifically, the following models are included:

*   **Make/Model:** Jaguar I-PACE
*   **Model Years:** 2020 and 2021
*   **Recall Numbers:** Jaguar's internal recall numbers are H570, H571, and H572. The NHTSA campaign number is 26V067000.

This recall replaces previous NHTSA recall numbers 23V369, 23V709, and 24V085. Owners of vehicles repaired under one or more of those previous recalls must still have this new remedy completed.

### What You Should Do
Until the recall repair is finished, owners are advised to take the following safety precautions:
*   Park the vehicle outside and away from structures.
*   Charge the vehicle outside.
*   Limit the battery charge to a maximum of 90%.

As an interim solution, dealers will update the battery software, or the update will be delivered over-the-air (OTA) to limit the state of charge to 90%. A final remedy is currently under development. All repairs and updates will be provided free of charge. 

Interim notification letters are expected to be mailed to owners by April 3, 2026. Owners may contact Jaguar customer service at 1-800-452-4827 for more information.

### Why This Matters
A high voltage battery that overheats presents a significant safety hazard, as it increases the likelihood of a vehicle fire, which could lead to property damage or personal injury.
