### What Happened
Daimler Vans USA, LLC (DVUSA) has announced a recall for specific Mercedes-Benz Metris right-hand-drive vehicles. The recall was initiated because water may accumulate on the vehicle's air bag control unit. This moisture buildup can cause the air bags to malfunction and fail to deploy as intended during a collision.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall potentially affects 52,356 units. The specific models involved are right-hand-drive versions of the following:
- **2020 Mercedes-Benz Metris**
- **2022 Mercedes-Benz Metris**
- **2023 Mercedes-Benz Metris**

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected vehicles should contact DVUSA customer service at **1-877-762-8267**. The official manufacturer recall number for this campaign is **VS2KORSRS**. 

Authorized dealers will install a protective cover on the air bag control unit free of charge to prevent water accumulation. Interim notification letters informing owners of the safety risk are expected to be mailed by March 20, 2026. A second notice will be sent once the final remedy is available, which is anticipated in April 2026. Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) for the affected vehicles will be searchable on the NHTSA website starting February 13, 2026.

### Why This Matters
Air bags are critical safety components designed to protect occupants during a collision. If an air bag fails to deploy as intended, there is a significantly increased risk of serious injury or death in the event of a crash.
