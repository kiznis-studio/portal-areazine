### What Happened
A minor earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 ml was recorded on February 11, 2026, at 10:45 AM local time (19:45 UTC). The seismic event occurred at a depth of 125 kilometers.

### Location Details
The earthquake's epicenter was located at coordinates 63.205°N, 150.493°W, approximately 72 km (45 miles) east-southeast of Denali National Park, Alaska. With a depth of 125 km, this is classified as a deep earthquake. Deep earthquakes—those occurring at depths greater than 70 km—are typically felt over a wider area but cause less intense shaking at the surface than shallower events of the same magnitude.

### Impact Assessment
At this time, there have been no felt reports submitted to the USGS regarding this event. There is no tsunami advisory, watch, or warning in effect. No automated alert level color was assigned to this event, and the status remains automatic.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are classified as minor. While they are often felt by people near the epicenter, they rarely cause structural damage. Residents are reminded that aftershocks are a possibility following seismic activity. In the event of stronger shaking, the recommended safety procedure is to Drop, Cover, and Hold On.
