### What Happened
Mameix Retail is recalling Scepter B62 gas and oil fuel containers because they violate mandatory federal safety standards. The containers lack required flame mitigation devices, posing a risk of flash fires. Additionally, the product's spout is not child-resistant, which creates a risk of burn and poisoning to children. These defects violate the Portable Fuel Container Safety Act and the Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves approximately 700 Scepter B62 gas and oil combination fuel containers. These red containers feature black caps and yellow spouts on each end. They are designed with dual chambers: a 6-liter gas capacity on one side and a 2.5-liter oil capacity on the other. The side of the container is embossed with "Scepter" and "Essence Danger."

The affected units were sold online at Amazon.com from August 2024 through May 2025 for about $40. No injuries have been reported to date.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled fuel containers and place them out of the reach of children. To receive a full refund, contact Mameix Retail. Consumers will be required to write "Recalled" in permanent marker on the container and submit a photo of the marked container in the trash to scepterrecall@gmail.com.

For more information, contact Mameix Retail collect at 587-816-2804 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. CT, Monday through Friday, or via email at scepterrecall@gmail.com.

### Why This Matters
The lack of mandatory safety features in these portable fuel containers poses a serious risk of death or injury from flash fires and accidental poisoning of children.
