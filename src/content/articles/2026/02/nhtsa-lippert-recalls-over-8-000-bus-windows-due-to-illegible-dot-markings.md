### What Happened
Lippert has initiated a recall for certain bus windows because they may feature illegible DOT markings. Due to this defect, the windows fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 205, "Glazing Materials."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 8,630 units. The specific products involved are:
- **Brand**: Lippert
- **Model**: Bus Window
- **Model Year**: 9999 (Multiple years/Aftermarket)
- **NHTSA Campaign Number**: 26E004000

Consumers should refer to the official recall report for the full list of affected part numbers.

### What You Should Do
The remedy for this issue is currently under development. Owners and operators who believe they have affected windows may contact Lippert customer service at 1-574-538-4514 for more information regarding the recall process and future repairs.

### Why This Matters
A missing or illegible DOT code mark is a safety concern because it may result in the window being replaced with an incorrect type of glass during future maintenance. Using non-compliant glass increases the risk of injury to passengers in the event of a breakage or accident.
