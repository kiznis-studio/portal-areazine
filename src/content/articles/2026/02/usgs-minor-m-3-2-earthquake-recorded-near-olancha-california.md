### What Happened
A minor earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 ml occurred on February 12, 2026, at 07:16:46 UTC (February 11, 2026, at 11:16 PM local time). The event was centered approximately 13 kilometers south of Olancha, California.

### Location Details
The seismic event was located at coordinates 36.171°N and 118.032°W. The earthquake occurred at a very shallow depth of 0.56 kilometers. In seismology, depths less than 20 kilometers are categorized as shallow; these events are often more noticeable to those directly above the epicenter than deeper quakes of a similar magnitude.

### Impact Assessment
According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), there were no immediate felt reports submitted at the time of the automated report. There is no tsunami advisory, watch, or warning in effect for this event. No specific PAGER alert level was issued, as the event falls within routine seismic parameters for the region.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are classified as minor. While these events are frequently felt by residents near the epicenter, they rarely cause structural damage. Residents in seismically active areas are reminded that aftershocks are a common occurrence following any seismic event, and safety protocols such as "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" should be followed if shaking occurs.
