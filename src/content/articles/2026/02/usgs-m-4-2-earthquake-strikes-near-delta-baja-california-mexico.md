### What Happened
A light earthquake with a magnitude of 4.2 (mlr) was recorded near Delta, Baja California, Mexico. The seismic event occurred on February 17, 2026, at 08:38:33 UTC (12:38 AM local time). The earthquake originated at a shallow depth of 6.76 km.

### Location Details
The epicenter was located at coordinates 32.387°N and 115.2545°W, approximately 7 km west-northwest of Delta, B.C., MX. Because the earthquake occurred at a depth of less than 20 km, it is classified as a shallow event. Shallow earthquakes are typically felt more intensely at the surface than deeper seismic events of the same magnitude.

### Impact Assessment
As of the latest data, 25 people have reported feeling the tremor to the USGS. The event has been assigned a "green" alert level, indicating a low likelihood of casualties or significant economic damage. A tsunami advisory status was associated with this event. The maximum estimated intensity was recorded at IV on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale, which corresponds to light shaking.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes categorized between M 4.0 and 4.9 are considered "light." While they cause noticeable shaking and are widely felt, they generally result in little to no structural damage. Residents in the region should be aware of the possibility of aftershocks. In the event of further shaking, remember to Drop, Cover, and Hold On.
