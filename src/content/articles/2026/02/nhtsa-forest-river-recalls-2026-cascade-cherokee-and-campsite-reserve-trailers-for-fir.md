### What Happened
Forest River, Inc. has issued a recall for several 2026 recreational trailer models due to a defect in the electrical system. The 7-way connector in these vehicles may have been incorrectly wired to a breaker that lacks over-current protection.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects a total of 741 units. The following 2026 models are included in this action:
- **Forest River Cherokee**
- **Forest River Cascade**
- **Forest River Campsite Reserve**

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected trailers are advised to contact Forest River customer service at 1-260-499-2100. Authorized dealers will correct the wiring free of charge to ensure proper over-current protection is in place. Forest River's internal identification number for this recall is **95-2019**. Official owner notification letters are expected to be mailed by March 4, 2026.

### Why This Matters
The absence of over-current protection in the electrical system means that a short circuit could occur. Such an event significantly increases the risk of a vehicle fire, which poses a serious safety hazard to consumers.
