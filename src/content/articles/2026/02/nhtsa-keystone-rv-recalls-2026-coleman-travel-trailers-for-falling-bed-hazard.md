### What Happened
Keystone RV Company has initiated a recall for certain 2026 Coleman travel trailers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the bed brackets in these vehicles may not have been properly secured to a wall stud. This manufacturing defect can cause the bed to fall unexpectedly.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects 115 units of the following vehicle:
- **Brand/Make**: Keystone
- **Model**: Coleman
- **Model Year**: 2026

Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) involved in this recall are expected to be searchable on the NHTSA website starting March 19, 2026.

### What You Should Do
Keystone RV Company will notify owners, and dealers will reinstall the bed brackets into a stud free of charge. Owner notification letters were mailed on February 3, 2026. Consumers with questions may contact Keystone customer service at 1-866-425-4369. The internal reference number for this recall is 26-479.

### Why This Matters
A Murphy bed that falls unexpectedly increases the risk of injury to occupants. Ensuring the brackets are anchored to a structural stud is necessary to prevent the bed from collapsing.
