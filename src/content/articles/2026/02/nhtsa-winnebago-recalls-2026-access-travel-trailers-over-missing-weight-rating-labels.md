### What Happened
Winnebago Towable has initiated a recall for certain 2026 Access travel trailers due to a labeling error. The affected vehicles may be missing the Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) on their certification labels. This omission means the trailers fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 49 CFR Part 567, "Certification."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall impacts approximately 100 units of the following vehicle:
*   **Make/Model**: 2026 Winnebago Access
*   **Model Year**: 2026
*   **Manufacturer Recall Number**: 44448204
*   **NHTSA Campaign Number**: 26V052000

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected travel trailers are advised to contact Winnebago customer service at 1-574-825-5280 (Extension 5220) for more information. Dealers or owners will be provided with a replacement label free of charge to resolve the issue. Winnebago expects to mail owner notification letters by March 19, 2026.

### Why This Matters
The absence of proper weight rating information can lead to unintentional overloading of the travel trailer. Overloading a vehicle can negatively impact handling and stability, thereby increasing the risk of a crash.
