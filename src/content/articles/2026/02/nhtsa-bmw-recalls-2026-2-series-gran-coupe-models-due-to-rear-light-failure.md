### What Happened

BMW of North America, LLC has issued a recall for specific 2026 model year vehicles due to a defect in the exterior lighting system. The affected vehicles are equipped with rear lights that may not function properly. As a result, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 108, which governs lamps, reflective devices, and associated equipment.

### Which Products Are Affected

A total of 606 units are impacted by this recall. The affected models include:

*   **2026 BMW 228i Gran Coupe**
*   **2026 BMW 228i xDrive Gran Coupe**
*   **2026 BMW M235i xDrive Gran Coupe**

### What You Should Do

BMW dealers will replace the rear lights on affected vehicles free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed by March 27, 2026. 

Owners may contact BMW customer service at **1-800-525-7417**. Additionally, starting March 27, 2026, owners can search for their specific Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on the NHTSA.gov website to confirm if their vehicle is included in this recall.

### Why This Matters

Properly functioning rear lighting is essential for road safety. A rear taillight, brake light, or turn signal that fails to operate correctly reduces the vehicle's visibility and prevents other drivers from seeing braking or turning intentions, significantly increasing the risk of a crash.
