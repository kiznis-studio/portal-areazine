### Location Details
The earthquake was recorded at coordinates 51.4357°S and 71.8959°W. The event originated at a depth of 11.5 kilometers. This is classified as a shallow earthquake; shallow quakes (those occurring at depths less than 20 km) are typically felt more strongly than deeper events because the seismic energy is released closer to the surface.

### Impact Assessment
At the time of this report, there has been 1 confirmed felt report submitted to the USGS regarding this event. No tsunami advisory, watch, or warning has been issued. There was no specific PAGER alert level color assigned to this event in the source data.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 4.0 and 4.9 are classified as "light." While they are frequently felt and can cause noticeable shaking, they typically result in little to no structural damage. Residents in the region should remain aware of the possibility of aftershocks, which are smaller seismic events that follow a larger earthquake. In the event of further shaking, safety experts recommend that you drop, cover, and hold on.
