A minor earthquake with a magnitude of 3.3 ml occurred on February 11, 2026, at 11:34 AM UTC (3:34 AM local time). The seismic event was centered approximately 5 km southwest of Ridgemark, California.

### Location Details
The earthquake was recorded at coordinates 36.782°N, 121.412°W. The USGS reported a depth of 8 km. This is classified as a shallow earthquake; seismic events occurring at depths of less than 20 km are typically felt more distinctly at the surface than deeper events.

### Impact Assessment

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are classified as minor. While these events are frequently felt by residents in the immediate area, they rarely cause structural damage. Residents should be aware that aftershocks are a routine possibility following seismic activity, though they are typically smaller than the initial event.
