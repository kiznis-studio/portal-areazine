### What Happened
Hyundai Motor America (Hyundai) has issued a recall for several Genesis vehicle models due to a software error that may cause the instrument panel display to fail. Because of this defect, the affected vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 101, regarding "Controls and Displays."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 83,877 units. The following models and years are included:
*   **2025-2026 Genesis G80**
*   **2025-2026 Genesis GV80**
*   **2026 Genesis G80 Electrified**
*   **2026 Genesis GV60**
*   **2026 Genesis GV70 Electrified**
*   **2026 Genesis GV70**

### What You Should Do
Owners are advised to disable the high definition (HD) radio feature as a temporary measure until the recall remedy has been performed. To fix the issue, the audio video navigation software will be updated. This update can be completed over-the-air (OTA) or by a dealer inspection and update, free of charge. 

Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed by March 16, 2026. Consumers may contact Genesis customer service at 844-340-9741. Hyundai's internal reference number for this recall is 031G. Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) became searchable on the NHTSA website starting January 17, 2026.

### Why This Matters
An instrument panel display that fails to show critical safety information, such as the speedometer or fuel gauge, prevents the driver from monitoring essential vehicle functions and significantly increases the risk of a crash.
