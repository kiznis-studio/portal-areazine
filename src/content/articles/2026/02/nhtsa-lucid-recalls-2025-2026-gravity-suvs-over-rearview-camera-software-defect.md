### What Happened
Lucid USA, Inc. (Lucid) has issued a recall for certain 2025-2026 Gravity vehicles due to a software issue that may prevent the rearview camera image from displaying when the vehicle is placed in reverse. This defect means the vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 111, "Rear Visibility."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 7,800 vehicles. The following models are included:
*   **2025 Lucid Gravity**
*   **2026 Lucid Gravity**

Affected vehicles are those operating on a software version prior to 3.3.20. The NHTSA campaign number for this recall is 26V018000, and Lucid's internal recall number is SR-26-02-0.

### What You Should Do
Lucid has already released an over-the-air (OTA) software update to correct the issue. This update is provided free of charge to owners. Official owner notification letters are expected to be mailed by March 13, 2026. Owners who have questions or require further assistance may contact Lucid customer service at 1-888-995-8243.

### Why This Matters
A rearview camera image that fails to display reduces the driver's visibility of the area behind the vehicle. This lack of visibility increases the risk of a crash or injury to pedestrians while the vehicle is in reverse.
