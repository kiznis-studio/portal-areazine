### What Happened
A minor earthquake with a magnitude of 3.3 ml was recorded on Sunday, February 15, 2026, at 02:49 UTC. The seismic event occurred approximately 92 km east-southeast of Egegik, Alaska, and was documented by the USGS.

### Location Details
The earthquake's epicenter was located at coordinates 57.892°N and 155.932°W. The event originated at a depth of 122.3 km. In geological terms, this is classified as a deep earthquake, as it occurred more than 70 km below the Earth's surface. Deep earthquakes are typically felt over a broader geographic area but generally result in less intense shaking at the surface compared to shallow events.

### Impact Assessment
According to the USGS, there have been no felt reports submitted by the public for this event at the time of reporting. There is no tsunami advisory, watch, or warning in effect (tsunami: 0). No alert level color was assigned to this routine seismic activity, and no damage or injuries have been reported.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are classified as minor. While they are often felt by people near the epicenter, they rarely cause structural damage. Residents in the region should remain aware that aftershocks are a common occurrence following seismic events. In the event of shaking, the standard safety procedure is to 'Drop, Cover, and Hold On.'
