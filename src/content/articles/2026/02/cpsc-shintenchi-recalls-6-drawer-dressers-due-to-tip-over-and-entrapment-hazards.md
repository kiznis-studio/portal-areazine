### What Happened
Shintenchi has issued a recall for approximately 600 of its 6-drawer dressers because they are unstable if not anchored to a wall. The products pose tip-over and entrapment hazards that can result in serious injury or death to children. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), these dressers violate the mandatory safety standards required by the STURDY Act for clothing storage units.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves Shintenchi-branded white dressers featuring six wooden drawers and golden metal feet. The units measure approximately 15.7 inches deep by 47.2 inches wide by 30.5 inches high. 

Consumers can identify the recalled product by the model number **SHX12077-WH**, which is embossed on the underside of the dresser at the top of one metal foot and printed on the product packaging. The dressers were sold online at Amazon.com from July 2025 through August 2025 for about $130.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled dressers if they are not anchored to the wall and move them to an area that is inaccessible to children. 

To receive a full refund, contact Shintenchi for instructions on how to properly dispose of the dresser. Consumers are required to submit a photo showing the disposal of the product to ShintenchiRecall@hotmail.com. For more information, consumers can visit http://www.shintenchi.com.cn and click "Recall" at the top of the page.

### Why This Matters
Clothing storage units that do not meet federal stability requirements pose a significant risk of falling onto children, which can lead to suffocation, internal injuries, or death. While no injuries have been reported to date for this specific model, the recall was initiated to prevent potential accidents.
