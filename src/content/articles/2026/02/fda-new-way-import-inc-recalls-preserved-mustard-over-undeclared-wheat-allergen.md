### What Happened
New Way Import Inc. of La Puente, California, has initiated a voluntary recall of its "Preserved Mustard in Soybean Oil" because the product contains wheat, an allergen that is not declared on the product packaging. The omission was identified during a classification process, leading to the firm-initiated recall to protect consumers with wheat sensitivities.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 55 cases (totaling 2,750 units) of the following product:

*   **Product Name**: Preserved Mustard in Soybean Oil
*   **Packaging**: Predominantly green packaging with gold accents and black Chinese lettering
*   **UPC**: 6 927393 804265
*   **Code Information**: Expiration date of MAY-20-2026

These products were distributed to 23 specific retail locations across the state of California.

### What You Should Do
Consumers who have purchased the affected Preserved Mustard and have an allergy or severe sensitivity to wheat are urged not to consume the product. The items should be disposed of or returned to the retail location where they were purchased. For further information, consumers may contact New Way Import Inc. at their La Puente facility located at 17823 E Valley Blvd.

### Why This Matters
For individuals with a wheat allergy or Celiac disease, consuming undeclared wheat can lead to serious or life-threatening allergic reactions. While this recall is classified as Class III, it remains a critical safety measure for the affected population.
