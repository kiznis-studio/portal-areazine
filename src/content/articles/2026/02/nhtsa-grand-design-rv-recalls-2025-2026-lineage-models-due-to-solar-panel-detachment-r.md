### What Happened
Grand Design RV, LLC has issued a recall for specific recreational vehicles due to a safety defect involving the solar panel mounting system. The adhesive used to secure the solar panels to the roof of the vehicle may fail. If the adhesive fails, the solar panel can detach from the roof while the vehicle is in motion.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall impacts approximately 920 units in total, specifically focusing on the following models:
- **Make/Model**: Grand Design Lineage
- **Model Years**: 2025 and 2026
- **NHTSA Campaign Number**: 26V042000
- **Manufacturer Recall Number**: M910053

### What You Should Do
Grand Design is currently developing a remedy for this issue. The company expects to mail interim owner notification letters explaining the safety risk on March 11, 2026. A second notice will be sent to owners once the final remedy becomes available. 

Owners with questions or concerns may contact Grand Design customer service directly at **1-574-825-9679**. 

### Why This Matters
A solar panel that detaches from a vehicle while driving becomes an immediate road hazard for other vehicles. This situation significantly increases the risk of a crash or property damage on public roadways.
