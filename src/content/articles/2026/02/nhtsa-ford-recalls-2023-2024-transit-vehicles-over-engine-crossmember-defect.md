### What Happened
Ford Motor Company has issued a recall for certain Transit vehicles due to a structural defect involving the engine crossmember. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the engine crossmember may not be secured properly. This defect can cause the engine to shift, which may result in a sudden loss of drive power or brake failure while the vehicle is in motion.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves the following vehicles:
*   **Make/Model**: Ford Transit
*   **Model Years**: 2023 and 2024
*   **Total Units Affected**: 2,806

Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) involved in this recall became searchable on the NHTSA website starting February 4, 2026.

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected vehicles should contact Ford customer service at **1-866-436-7332**. Ford's internal reference number for this recall is **26S04**. 

Authorized dealers will replace the engine crossmember fasteners free of charge. Ford expects to mail interim notification letters to owners regarding the safety risk by February 20, 2026. A second letter will be sent once the final remedy is available for implementation.

### Why This Matters
A loss of drive power or the failure of the braking system significantly increases the risk of a motor vehicle crash and potential injury to occupants or others on the road.
