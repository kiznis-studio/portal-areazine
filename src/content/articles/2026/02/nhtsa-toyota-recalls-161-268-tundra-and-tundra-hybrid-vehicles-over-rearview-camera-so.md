### What Happened

Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing (Toyota) is recalling specific 2024-2025 Tundra and Tundra Hybrid vehicles equipped with a Panoramic View Monitor (PVM) system. In these vehicles, the rearview camera image may not display when the vehicle is placed in reverse. This failure to display an image means the vehicles do not comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 111, "Rear Visibility."

### Which Products Are Affected

The recall affects approximately 161,268 units. The following models are included in the recall:

*   **2024-2025 Toyota Tundra**
*   **2024-2025 Toyota Tundra Hybrid**

### What You Should Do

Owners of the affected vehicles should contact a Toyota dealer to receive a free software update for the parking assist ECU. Toyota expects to begin mailing owner notification letters on March 10, 2026. 

For more information, consumers may contact Toyota customer service at **1-800-331-4331**. Owners should reference Toyota's internal recall numbers **26TB02** and **26TA02** when inquiring about this service.

### Why This Matters

A rearview camera image that fails to display reduces the driver's visibility behind the vehicle while in reverse. This defect increases the risk of a crash or injury to pedestrians.
