### What Happened
Chrysler (FCA US, LLC) has announced a recall of certain Mopar trailer tow modules due to a design defect. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the improperly designed modules can cause trailer lights to fail to illuminate and may also lead to the failure of trailer brakes.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 2,871 Mopar Trailer Tow Modules. The affected components are identified under NHTSA Campaign Number 26E006000 and FCA US, LLC recall number 04D. These modules are listed under model year 9999, typically indicating aftermarket equipment or components not tied to a single vehicle model year.

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected modules are advised to contact FCA US, LLC customer service at 1-800-853-1403. For modules already installed in a vehicle, dealers will replace the trailer tow module free of charge. If the module has been purchased but not yet installed in a vehicle, dealers will repurchase the unit. Owner notification letters are scheduled to be mailed on March 24, 2026.

### Why This Matters
The failure of trailer brake lights and turn signals reduces the vehicle's visibility to other drivers, while the failure of trailer brakes significantly increases the distance required to stop. Both conditions pose a substantial risk of a crash.
