### What Happened
Ford Motor Company is recalling certain 2025 F-53 and F-59 vehicles due to an incorrectly installed stop light switch. This defect causes the exterior brake lights to either illuminate unexpectedly or fail to illuminate when the brake pedal is activated. Consequently, these vehicles fail to meet the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 108, which governs lamps, reflective devices, and associated equipment.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects a total of 462 units. The specific models involved are:
*   **2025 Ford F-53**
*   **2025 Ford F-59**

Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) for the affected units became searchable on the NHTSA website starting January 22, 2026.

### What You Should Do
Ford will notify owners, and dealers will replace the stop light switch free of charge. Owner notification letters were mailed on January 30, 2026. Owners may contact Ford customer service at **1-866-436-7332**. Ford's internal reference number for this recall is **26C01**. 

### Why This Matters
Brake lights that do not function correctly increase the risk of a crash because trailing drivers may not be alerted when the vehicle is slowing or stopping. Furthermore, this defect may allow the vehicle to be shifted out of the "park" position without the brake pedal being applied, which increases the risk of a vehicle rollaway.
