## What Happened

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced that three pharmaceutical manufacturers are voluntarily recalling specific batches of metformin extended-release (ER) tablets after routine testing detected levels of N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) exceeding the acceptable daily intake limit.

NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen. While short-term exposure is not expected to increase cancer risk, prolonged exposure above acceptable limits may pose health concerns.

## Which Products Are Affected

| Manufacturer | Product | Lot Numbers | Expiration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apotex Corp. | Metformin ER 500mg | A2024-0156, A2024-0189 | 03/2027 |
| Amneal Pharma | Metformin ER 750mg | MF-2024-882 through MF-2024-901 | 06/2027 |
| Marksans Pharma | Metformin ER 500mg | MK-500-2401 | 12/2026 |

## What You Should Do

1. **Do not stop taking metformin** without consulting your doctor — the risk of uncontrolled diabetes is greater than the risk from NDMA exposure
2. **Check your medication** against the lot numbers listed above (printed on the bottle label)
3. **Contact your pharmacy** for a replacement from a different manufacturer
4. **Report side effects** to the FDA's MedWatch program at **1-800-FDA-1088**

## Why This Matters

Metformin is one of the most widely prescribed medications in the United States, used by millions of people to manage type 2 diabetes. The FDA first identified NDMA contamination issues in metformin products in 2020 and has since increased testing.

The FDA stresses that patients should continue their diabetes treatment while seeking replacement medication. Pharmacists can substitute products from unaffected manufacturers.
