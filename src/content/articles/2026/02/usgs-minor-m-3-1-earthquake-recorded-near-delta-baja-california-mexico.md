### What Happened
A minor earthquake with a magnitude of 3.1 ml occurred on February 13, 2026, at 09:01 UTC. The seismic event was centered approximately 8 kilometers (5 miles) northwest of Delta, Baja California, Mexico. 

### Location Details
The earthquake was located at coordinates 32.397°N and 115.268°W. The event originated at a depth of 4.44 kilometers (approximately 2.7 miles). This is classified as a shallow earthquake; shallow events (those occurring at depths less than 20 km) are typically felt more distinctly by those near the epicenter than deeper seismic events, though the magnitude of this specific event is low.

### Impact Assessment
At the time of reporting, there have been no felt reports submitted to the USGS regarding this earthquake. There is no tsunami advisory, watch, or warning in effect. No specific alert level color has been assigned to this event, which is consistent with routine seismic activity in the region.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are classified as minor. While these events are often felt by people in the immediate vicinity, they rarely cause structural damage. Residents should be aware that aftershocks are a possibility following any seismic event, though they are typically smaller than the initial quake. In the event of shaking, safety officials recommend that you "Drop, Cover, and Hold On."
