### What Happened
A minor earthquake with a magnitude of 3.4 ml occurred on February 14, 2026, at 10:54 PM UTC (1:54 PM local time). The seismic event was centered approximately 1 km northwest of Point MacKenzie, Alaska, at a depth of 32.2 km.

### Location Details
The earthquake's epicenter was located at coordinates 61.368°N and 149.991°W. The recorded depth of 32.2 km places this event in the intermediate category (20-70 km). Intermediate-depth earthquakes typically cause less intense shaking at the surface than shallower events of the same magnitude.

### Impact Assessment
According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), 28 individuals submitted felt reports following the tremor. There was no tsunami advisory, watch, or warning issued in connection with this event. No specific alert level color was assigned, and there are no reports of damage or injuries associated with this routine seismic activity.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are classified as minor. While these events are often felt by people near the epicenter, they rarely cause damage to buildings or infrastructure. Residents are reminded that aftershocks are possible following any seismic event, though they are generally smaller than the initial earthquake.
