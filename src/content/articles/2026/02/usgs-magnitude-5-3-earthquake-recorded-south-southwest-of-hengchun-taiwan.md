The earthquake's epicenter was located at coordinates 20.4833°N and 120.1538°E. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the event occurred at a depth of 15.1 kilometers. This is classified as a shallow earthquake; seismic events occurring at depths of less than 20 kilometers are often more widely felt at the surface than deeper quakes.

### What You Should Know
A magnitude 5.3 earthquake is considered a "moderate" event. While earthquakes of this size can cause damage to poorly constructed buildings, they typically result in light or no damage to well-built structures. Residents in the surrounding region should be aware of the potential for aftershocks. In the event of seismic activity, safety experts recommend that you "Drop, Cover, and Hold On."
