### What Happened
A moderate earthquake with a magnitude of 5.5 Mi occurred on February 11, 2026, at 10:30:17 UTC (8:30 PM local time in Guam). The seismic event was recorded at a depth of 152 kilometers.

### Location Details
The epicenter was located at coordinates 13.97°N, 144.858°E, approximately 48 kilometers north of Yigo Village, Guam. The recorded depth of 152 km classifies this as a deep earthquake. Deep earthquakes (those occurring at depths greater than 70 km) are typically felt over a wide area but are generally less likely to cause significant surface damage than shallow events.

### Impact Assessment
As of the latest report, 12 individuals have submitted felt reports to the USGS, with a Community Decimal Intensity (CDI) of 3.8. There is no tsunami advisory, watch, or threat in effect following this earthquake. No specific alert level color was assigned to this event in the source data.

### What You Should Know
Moderate earthquakes (M 5.0-5.9) are capable of causing damage to poorly constructed buildings, though the significant depth of this particular event often mitigates the intensity of shaking felt at the surface. Residents in the region should remain aware of the possibility of aftershocks. In the event of further seismic activity, safety officials recommend that you "Drop, Cover, and Hold On."
