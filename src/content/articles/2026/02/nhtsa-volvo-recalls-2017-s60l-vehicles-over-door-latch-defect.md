### What Happened
Volvo Car USA, LLC (Volvo Car) has issued a recall for certain 2017 S60L vehicles due to a defect in the door latch assembly. A component within the door latch may break, which prevents the door from latching properly. Consequently, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 206, which governs "Door Locks and Door Retention Components."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects the following vehicles:
*   **Make/Model**: Volvo S60L
*   **Model Year**: 2017
*   **Total Units Affected**: 2,758

This recall is an expansion of a previous action, NHTSA recall number 19V849.

### What You Should Do
Owners of affected vehicles are advised to contact their local Volvo dealer to arrange for a repair. Dealers will replace all four door latches on the vehicle free of charge. 

Volvo expects to mail owner notification letters on February 23, 2026. Owners may contact Volvo Car’s customer service at 1-800-458-1552 and reference Volvo's internal recall number **R89978**. Additionally, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) involved in this recall became searchable on the NHTSA website as of January 19, 2026.

### Why This Matters
A door that is not securely latched can open unexpectedly while the vehicle is in motion. This defect significantly increases the risk of injury to vehicle occupants or others on the road.
