### What Happened
Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. is recalling certain 2023-2024 ID.4 vehicles due to a defect in the high voltage (HV) battery cell modules. The modules may contain misaligned electrodes, which can result in a battery fire occurring while the vehicle is either parked or being driven.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects the following vehicles:
*   **Make/Model**: Volkswagen ID.4
*   **Model Years**: 2023 and 2024
*   **Total Units Affected**: 1,340
*   **Recall Number**: 93EW

### What You Should Do
Owners are advised to take immediate precautions until the recall repair is completed:
*   **Parking**: Park the vehicle outside immediately after charging and do not leave the vehicle charging indoors overnight.
*   **Charging Limits**: Do not use Level 3 DC chargers and limit the maximum battery charge to 80%.
*   **Repair**: Volkswagen dealers will replace the high voltage battery cell modules as necessary, free of charge.

Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed on March 20, 2026. Owners may contact Volkswagen customer service at 1-800-893-5298. Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) became searchable on the NHTSA website starting January 23, 2026.

### Why This Matters
A vehicle fire while parked or driving significantly increases the risk of injury to occupants and bystanders. The misalignment of electrodes within the traction battery creates a specific hazard that requires immediate mitigation through altered charging habits and professional repair.
