### What Happened
A light magnitude 4.3 (mb) earthquake was recorded on Friday, February 13, 2026, at 11:33:39 UTC. The seismic event occurred at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the earthquake has been reviewed by a seismologist.

### Location Details
The epicenter was located at coordinates 27.6913°N, 55.8504°E, approximately 68 km south of Ḩājjīābād, Iran. The depth of 10 km is classified as shallow; shallow earthquakes (those less than 20km deep) are typically felt more distinctly than deeper events because the energy is released closer to the surface.

### Impact Assessment
At this time, there are no felt reports submitted to the USGS. No tsunami advisory, watch, or warning has been issued in connection with this event. There is currently no PAGER alert level assigned to this earthquake.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with a magnitude between 4.0 and 4.9 are classified as "light." While they are often noticeable and can cause shaking of indoor items, they rarely cause significant structural damage. Residents in the vicinity should be aware of the potential for aftershocks. In the event of further seismic activity, safety officials recommend that you "Drop, Cover, and Hold On."
