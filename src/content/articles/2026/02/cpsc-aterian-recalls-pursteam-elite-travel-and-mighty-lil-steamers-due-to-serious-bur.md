### What Happened
Aterian, Inc. has issued a recall for two models of PurSteam steamers because the devices can expel hot water from the steam nozzle during use. This defect poses a serious burn hazard to consumers. The company has received 80 reports of hot water expulsion from the Elite Travel Steamer (including 14 burn injuries) and 392 reports from the Mighty Lil Steamer (including 40 burn injuries, two of which were second-degree burns).

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves approximately 75,400 PurSteam Elite Travel Steamers and 119,000 PurSteam Mighty Lil Steamers purchased after December 2020 or bearing specific date codes. 

**Affected Models:**
*   **PurSteam Elite Travel Steamer (Model PS-510):** A white steamer with a triangular steam vent opening and a wave-shaped water reservoir window.
*   **PurSteam Mighty Lil Steamer (Model PS-550):** A white steamer with an oblong steam vent opening.

**Date Codes (YYMM format on the bottom label):**
2310, 2308, 2305, 2304, 2303, 2212, 2211, 2210, 2203, 2112, 2111, 2110, 0221, 1019, and 4619.

These products were sold online at Pursteam.com, Amazon.com, and Walmart.com between December 2020 and April 2025 for prices ranging from $11 to $35.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled steamers. To receive a full refund, owners must visit **recall.pursteam.com** to submit a request. The process requires consumers to provide contact information, cut the steamer's power cord, and upload a photo of the disabled unit with the cut cord. Consumers should retain the steamer until the refund is received, as Aterian may request some units be returned via a prepaid shipping mailer.

For additional information, contact Aterian toll-free at 833-910-6095 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET Monday through Friday, or email recall@pursteam.com.

### Why This Matters
This recall is significant due to the high volume of reported incidents and the severity of injuries, which include at least 54 documented burn injuries and reports of second-degree burns resulting from the expelled hot water.
