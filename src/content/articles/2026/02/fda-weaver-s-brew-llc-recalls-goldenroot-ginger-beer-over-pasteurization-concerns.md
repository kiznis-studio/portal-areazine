### What Happened
Weaver's Brew LLC has voluntarily initiated a recall of its Goldenroot Yuzu Ginger Lemongrass Ginger Beer. The recall was issued because the ginger juice used in the beverage did not undergo the required pasteurization process. This failure to pasteurize the juice means the product may not meet necessary food safety standards.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves 649 cases of the following product:

*   **Product Name**: Goldenroot Yuzu Ginger Lemongrass Ginger Beer
*   **Size**: 12 oz. (355 ml)

*   **Code Information**: All "Use By" dates up to 6/14/26
*   **Distribution**: The product was distributed to retailers in Texas and California.

The packaging includes the instruction "Keep Cold" and identifies the manufacturer as Goldenroot, located at 3841 Market St #113, Denton, TX 76209.

### What You Should Do
Consumers who have purchased the affected Goldenroot Ginger Beer are advised not to consume the product. Affected items should be disposed of or returned to the place of purchase. For further inquiries, the recalling firm, Weaver's Brew LLC, is located at 3841 Market St Ste 113, Denton, TX 76209.

### Why This Matters
