### What Happened

Gulf Stream Coach, Inc. (Gulf Stream) is recalling certain 2026 Trail Boss and Ameri-Lite trailers due to a manufacturing defect in the exterior lighting system. Wires within the taillight harness may have been installed in reverse. This error causes the turn signals to activate in the opposite direction of the driver’s intended signal. As a result, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 108, "Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment."

### Which Products Are Affected

The recall impacts approximately 172 units. The following models are included:

*   **Manufacturer**: Gulf Stream Coach, Inc.
*   **Models**: 2026 Gulf Stream Trail Boss and 2026 Gulf Stream Ameri-Lite
*   **NHTSA Campaign Number**: 26V010000

### What You Should Do

Owners are strongly advised **not to tow their trailers** until the necessary repairs have been completed. Gulf Stream dealers will rewire the turn signals free of charge to correct the issue. 

Owner notification letters were mailed on January 21, 2026. Owners with questions may contact Gulf Stream customer service at **1-800-289-8787**. Additionally, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) for the affected trailers will be searchable on the NHTSA.gov website starting January 31, 2026.

### Why This Matters

Turn signals that fail to accurately indicate a driver's intention to change direction or turn can confuse other motorists and significantly increase the risk of a crash.
