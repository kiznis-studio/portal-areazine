### What Happened
FWMOTO INC. (FLYE) has initiated a recall for certain scooter models due to concerns regarding the braking system. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the brake pads on these vehicles may provide insufficient braking performance. This defect causes the scooters to fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 122, which governs "Motorcycle Brake Systems."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves approximately 1,835 units. The following models and years are included in the recall:
*   **2024 FWMOTO FLY-10**
*   **2022-2024 FLY E-BIKE FLY-10**

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected scooters are encouraged to take immediate action. FLYE has stated they will either replace the brake pads free of charge or offer to repurchase the scooter from the owner. 

Official owner notification letters are expected to be sent via mail by March 15, 2026. In the meantime, consumers may contact FLYE customer service directly at **646-961-5177** or via email at **support@flyebike.com** for further instructions regarding the remedy process.

### Why This Matters
Insufficient braking performance is a significant safety hazard that can extend the distance required to stop the vehicle or lead to a total loss of control. These conditions significantly increase the risk of a crash or serious injury to the rider and others on the road.
