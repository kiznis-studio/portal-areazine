### What Happened
Grand Design RV, LLC has issued a safety recall for certain 2025-2026 Lineage motorhomes. The manufacturer determined that the seat bases for the driver and front passenger seats may have been improperly tightened during assembly. This defect can cause the seat bases to become loose, which means the vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 207, "Seating Systems."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects a total of 1,366 units. The specific vehicles involved are:
*   **Make:** Grand Design
*   **Model:** Lineage
*   **Model Years:** 2025 and 2026

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected motorhomes should contact an authorized Grand Design dealer to arrange for a free inspection. Dealers will tighten the seat bases as necessary at no cost to the consumer. 

Official owner notification letters are expected to be mailed by March 11, 2026. Consumers with questions may contact Grand Design customer service at 1-574-825-9679. When calling, owners should reference Grand Design's internal recall number: **M910057**.

### Why This Matters
A loose seat base compromises the integrity of the vehicle's seating system. In the event of a crash, an unsecured seat significantly increases the risk of injury to the driver or front passenger.
