### What Happened
A light earthquake with a magnitude of 4.4 mb occurred on February 11, 2026, at 06:41:27 UTC. The seismic event was centered approximately 82 kilometers north-northeast of Ollagüe, Chile, and has been officially reviewed by seismologists.

### Location Details
The earthquake's epicenter was located at coordinates 20.5653°S, 67.8937°W. The event originated at a depth of 167.276 kilometers. According to geological standards, this is classified as a deep earthquake, as it occurred significantly below the 70-kilometer threshold. Deep earthquakes are generally felt over a wider area but are typically less destructive at the surface than shallow seismic events.

### Impact Assessment
At the time of reporting, there have been no felt reports submitted to the USGS. There is no tsunami advisory, watch, or warning in effect for this event. No specific PAGER alert level color has been assigned to this activity, and the event is considered routine for this seismically active region.

### What You Should Know
A magnitude 4.4 earthquake is categorized as a "light" earthquake. While such events result in noticeable shaking, they rarely cause significant structural damage, especially when occurring at great depths. Residents are reminded that aftershocks are possible following any seismic event, though they are usually lower in magnitude than the initial quake.
