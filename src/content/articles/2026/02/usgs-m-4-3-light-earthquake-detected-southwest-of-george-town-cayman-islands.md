### What Happened
A light earthquake with a magnitude of 4.3 mb occurred on February 10, 2026, at 09:43:40 UTC. The seismic event was centered approximately 218 kilometers (135 miles) southwest of George Town, Cayman Islands. The earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers.

### Location Details
The earthquake's epicenter was located at coordinates 17.6693°N and 82.5682°W. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the event occurred at a depth of 10 km. Earthquakes at this depth—less than 20 km—are classified as shallow. While shallow earthquakes can sometimes result in more intense shaking at the surface, the distance of this event from major population centers may mitigate its impact.

### Impact Assessment
Based on the current data from the USGS, there is no tsunami advisory, watch, or warning in effect (tsunami: 0). No felt reports have been officially submitted to the USGS at this time, and there are no current alert levels or reported damage associated with this event.

### What You Should Know
A magnitude 4.3 earthquake is classified as a "light" earthquake. While such events are often noticeable and can cause light damage to poorly constructed buildings, their impact is typically limited. Residents in the region should be aware that aftershocks are a routine possibility following seismic activity, though they are generally smaller than the initial event. In the event of shaking, remember to "Drop, Cover, and Hold On."
