### What Happened
Prima Vera Nueva, Inc., based in Sonoma, California, has initiated a voluntary recall of its BBQ Chipotle Bean & White Cheddar Tamales. The recall was issued following the discovery of potential contamination with *Listeria monocytogenes*, a biological hazard that can cause serious foodborne illness.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves 27,964 packages of tamales distributed across California and Nevada. The affected products are identified by the following details:

*   **Product Name**: BBQ Chipotle Bean & White Cheddar Tamales
*   **Brand**: Primavera
*   **UPC**: 748732000256
*   **Quantity**: 27,964 packages (each containing 4 tamales)
*   **Weight**: 24 oz. net weight
*   **Packaging**: Perishable, keep refrigerated

The ingredients listed on the packaging include organic corn flour masa, beans, jack cheese, salsa, butter, non-GMO corn, salt, spices, and baking powder.

### What You Should Do
Consumers who have purchased the affected tamales are urged not to consume them. The product should be discarded or returned to the place of purchase. For questions or additional information, consumers can contact Prima Vera Nueva, Inc. at (707) 939-9350. The company is located at 17070 Sonoma Highway, Sonoma, CA 95476.

### Why This Matters
*Listeria monocytogenes* is a pathogen that can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, and newborns. While the FDA has classified this as a Class II recall, the presence of biological hazards in ready-to-eat food products represents a significant public health risk.
