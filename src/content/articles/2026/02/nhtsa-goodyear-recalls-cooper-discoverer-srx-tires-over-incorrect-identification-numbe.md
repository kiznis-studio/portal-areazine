### What Happened
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (Goodyear) has initiated a recall for specific Cooper Discoverer SRX tires. The recall was prompted by the discovery of incorrect Tire Identification Numbers (TIN) on the products. This labeling error results in a failure to meet the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 574, which governs "Tire Identification & Recordkeeping."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves approximately 730 units of the following product:
*   **Brand/Model**: Cooper Discoverer SRX
*   **Size**: 255/50R20
*   **NHTSA Campaign Number**: 26T002000

### What You Should Do
Consumers who own the affected tires are advised to contact an authorized dealer to receive a free replacement. Goodyear began mailing notification letters to registered owners on January 28, 2026. For more information or questions regarding the replacement process, owners may contact Goodyear Customer Service at 800-321-2136.

### Why This Matters
The incorrect TIN prevents owners from properly registering their tires. Without accurate registration information, consumers may not receive future safety recall notices, which could lead to the prolonged use of a faulty tire and increase the risk of a vehicle crash.
