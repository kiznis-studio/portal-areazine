### What Happened
Kitosun has issued a recall for its submersible LED lights because the products violate mandatory federal safety standards for button cell and coin batteries. The battery compartments can be accessed too easily by children, and the products lack the required safety warnings mandated by Reese’s Law. When swallowed, these batteries can cause internal chemical burns, serious injury, or death.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves approximately 8,100 units of Kitosun Submersible LED Lights. Each set includes:
- 10 color-changing LED lights (approximately 3.5 cm in diameter)
- Two remote controls
- 20 preinstalled CR2450 lithium batteries (inside the lights)
- Four preinstalled CR2032 lithium batteries (inside the remotes)

The products were sold online at Amazon.com from March 2024 through November 2025 for about $23. 

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled LED lights and keep them out of the reach of children. To receive a full refund, consumers should contact Kitosun by email at **sales@kitosun.com**. 

Note that button cell and coin batteries are hazardous and should be disposed of or recycled according to local hazardous waste procedures. While no injuries have been reported to date, the CPSC advises immediate action due to the severity of the ingestion risk.

### Why This Matters
Lithium coin batteries can cause catastrophic internal damage or death within hours if ingested by a child. This recall ensures that products sold to consumers meet mandatory safety standards designed to prevent accidental battery access.
