### What You Should Do
Residents are advised to prepare for critical fire weather. A Red Flag Warning means that extreme fire behavior is possible due to the combination of environmental factors. Residents should exercise extreme caution with any activities that could cause a spark, as dry fuels and strong winds can contribute to rapid and erratic fire spread.

* **Temperature:** Unseasonably warm conditions are expected, with high temperatures reaching the mid to upper 50s.
* **Fuels:** The region currently contains dry cured fuels, which increase the risk of fire ignition and spread.
