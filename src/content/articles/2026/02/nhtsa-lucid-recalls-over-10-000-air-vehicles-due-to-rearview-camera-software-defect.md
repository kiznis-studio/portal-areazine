### What Happened
Lucid USA, Inc. (Lucid) is recalling certain Lucid Air vehicles due to a software defect that may prevent the rearview camera image from displaying when the vehicle is placed in reverse. This malfunction results in the vehicles failing to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 111, "Rear Visibility."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 10,816 units. The specific vehicles involved are:
*   **Brand/Model**: Lucid Air
*   **Model Years**: 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026
*   **Specifications**: Vehicles must be equipped with an AD02 package and operating a software version ranging from 2.8.0 through 2.8.16.

### What You Should Do
Lucid has released an over-the-air (OTA) software update to address the issue, which is provided free of charge to owners. Official owner notification letters are expected to be mailed by March 13, 2026. 

Owners may contact Lucid customer service at 1-888-995-8243 for more information. Lucid's internal reference number for this recall is SR-26-01-0. Owners may also contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline or visit their website regarding campaign number 26V017000.

### Why This Matters
A rearview image that does not display properly reduces the driver's visibility behind the vehicle. This lack of visibility significantly increases the risk of a crash or injury to individuals behind the vehicle.
