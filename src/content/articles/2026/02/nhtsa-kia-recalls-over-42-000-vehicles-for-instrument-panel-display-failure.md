### What Happened
Kia America, Inc. has initiated a recall for several 2025 and 2026 vehicle models due to a software error that may cause the instrument panel display to fail. This malfunction prevents the display of critical safety information, resulting in non-compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) numbers 101, "Controls and Displays," and 138, "Tire Pressure Monitoring System."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 42,677 units. The following models and years are included:
* **2025 Kia K4**
* **2025-2026 Kia Sorento, Sorento Hybrid, and Sorento Plug-In Hybrid Electric (PHEV)**
* **2026 Kia Sportage, Sportage Hybrid, and Sportage PHEV**
* **2026 Kia K5**
* **2026 Kia EV9**
* **2026 Kia Carnival and Carnival Hybrid**

### What You Should Do
Kia will provide a software update for the instrument panel display free of charge. This update can be performed over-the-air (OTA) or by a Kia dealer. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed by March 26, 2026.

Owners may contact Kia Customer Service at 1-800-333-4542 and reference recall number **SC361**. Additionally, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) involved in this recall will be searchable on the NHTSA website starting February 9, 2026.

### Why This Matters
An instrument panel that fails to display essential information such as the speedometer, tire pressure, or warning lights significantly increases the risk of a crash.
