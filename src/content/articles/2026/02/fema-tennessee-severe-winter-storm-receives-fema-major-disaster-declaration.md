### Federal Assistance Available
FEMA has authorized **Public Assistance** for all 23 designated counties. This program provides supplemental grants to state, tribal, and local governments, and certain private non-profit organizations, to assist with emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities. 

At this time, Individual Assistance (IA), Individuals and Households (IH) programs, and Hazard Mitigation (HM) programs have not been activated under this specific declaration.

### What You Should Do
Representatives of local government agencies and eligible non-profits in the affected counties should contact their state emergency management agency to begin the application process for Public Assistance.
