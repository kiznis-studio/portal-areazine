### What Happened
A minor earthquake with a magnitude of 3.1 ml occurred on February 10, 2026, at 03:04:41 UTC. The seismic event was recorded by the USGS and centered in a remote region of Alaska.

### Location Details
The earthquake's epicenter was located at coordinates 63.097°N, 150.958°W, approximately 62 km southeast of Denali National Park, Alaska. The event originated at a depth of 125.7 km. In geological terms, this is classified as a deep earthquake, as it occurred more than 70 km below the Earth's surface. Deep earthquakes are typically felt over a wider area but result in less intense shaking at the surface compared to shallow events.

### Impact Assessment
According to the USGS, there have been no felt reports submitted by the public for this event. There is no tsunami advisory, watch, or warning in effect. No alert level color has been assigned to this routine seismic activity, and there are no reports of damage or injuries.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are classified as minor. While they are occasionally felt by residents, they rarely cause structural damage. Residents in seismically active regions like Alaska are encouraged to maintain a basic emergency kit and be aware that minor aftershocks are a common occurrence following such events, though they may not be felt due to the significant depth of this specific earthquake.
