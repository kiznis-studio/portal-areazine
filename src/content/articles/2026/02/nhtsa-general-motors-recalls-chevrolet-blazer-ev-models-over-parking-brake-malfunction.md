### What Happened
General Motors, LLC (GM) has issued a recall for specific 2024-2025 Chevrolet Blazer EV vehicles that may have been repaired incorrectly under a previous recall (25V433). The rear parking brake wiring harness in these vehicles may become damaged or corroded. This defect can result in the unintended activation of the parking brake while the vehicle is in motion or the total loss of parking brake function while the vehicle is stationary.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 20 units. The specific models included are:
*   **Make/Model**: Chevrolet Blazer EV
*   **Model Years**: 2024 and 2025

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected vehicles should wait for official notification letters, which are expected to be mailed on March 9, 2026. GM dealers will replace the chassis harness free of charge to resolve the issue. Owners may contact Chevrolet customer service at 1-800-222-1020 and reference GM recall number **N252532830** or NHTSA campaign number **26V031000**.

### Why This Matters
This defect poses two significant safety risks: the unintended activation of the parking brake while driving increases the likelihood of a crash, while the loss of parking brake function while parked can result in a vehicle rollaway, further increasing the risk of accidents or injuries.
