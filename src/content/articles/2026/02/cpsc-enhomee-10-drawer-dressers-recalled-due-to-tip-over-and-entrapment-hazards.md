### What Happened
EnHomee has issued a recall for its 10-drawer dressers because they are unstable if not anchored to a wall. This instability poses tip-over and entrapment hazards that can result in serious injury or death to children. The products violate the mandatory safety standards required by the STURDY Act for clothing storage units.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves approximately 5,000 EnHomee 10-Drawer Dressers. These units feature a metal frame, a wooden top, 10 collapsible fabric drawers, and two metal drawers. 

*   **Colors**: Black, white, grey, and brown.
*   **Dimensions**: 38 inches long by 11.8 inches wide by 48.1 inches tall.
*   **Model Number**: 55SCWMSCXLBR (This number can be found in the order information within the consumer's Amazon account).
*   **Sales Period**: Sold online at Amazon.com from September 2023 through December 2025 for about $115.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled dressers if they are not anchored to the wall and place them in an area that children cannot access. 

To receive a full refund, consumers must contact EnHomee for instructions on how to identify affected units and dispose of the product. Consumers are required to submit a photo to enhomeestore@gmail.com showing the disposal of the dresser. 

**Contact Information:**
*   **Phone**: 833-668-8899 (9 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT, Monday through Friday)
*   **Email**: enhomeestore@gmail.com
*   **Online**: [enhomee.store/recall.html](https://enhomee.store/recall.html) or [enhomee.store](https://enhomee.store/) (click "Recall" at the top of the page).

### Why This Matters
This recall is significant because the dressers fail to meet federal stability requirements, creating a risk of fatal entrapment for children if the unit tips over. While no injuries have been reported to date, the violation of the STURDY Act indicates a serious safety defect.
