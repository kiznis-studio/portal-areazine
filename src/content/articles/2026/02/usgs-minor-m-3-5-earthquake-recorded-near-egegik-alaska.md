### What Happened
A minor magnitude 3.5 ml earthquake occurred on Sunday, February 22, 2026, at 13:52 UTC (04:52 AM local time). The seismic event was recorded at a depth of 169.3 kilometers.

### Location Details
The earthquake was centered approximately 48 kilometers southeast of Egegik, Alaska, at coordinates 57.881°N and 156.844°W. With a recorded depth of 169.3 km, this event is classified as a deep earthquake (greater than 70 km). Deep earthquakes are generally less likely to cause significant shaking or damage at the surface compared to shallow events.

### Impact Assessment

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are considered minor. While they are often felt by people near the epicenter, they rarely cause damage to buildings or infrastructure. Residents in seismic zones should be aware that aftershocks are a routine possibility following any earthquake, though the depth of this specific event may limit the number of felt aftershocks.
