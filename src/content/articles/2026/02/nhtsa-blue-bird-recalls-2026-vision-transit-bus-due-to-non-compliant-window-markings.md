### What Happened
Blue Bird Body Company has issued a recall for a single 2026 Vision transit bus due to a non-compliance issue with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 205, "Glazing Materials." The windows on the affected vehicle may have illegible DOT markings, which are required for identifying the specific type of safety glass used in the vehicle.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall is highly specific, affecting only one (1) unit:
*   **Make/Model**: Blue Bird Vision Transit Bus
*   **Model Year**: 2026
*   **NHTSA Campaign Number**: 26V033000

### What You Should Do
The remedy for this issue is currently under development by the manufacturer. Blue Bird expects to mail an official owner notification letter on March 20, 2026. Owners of the vehicle or fleet managers may contact Blue Bird's customer service department at 1-478-822-2242 for further instructions and updates regarding the repair process.

### Why This Matters
Illegible or missing DOT code marks on vehicle glazing can lead to a window being replaced with an incorrect type of glass during future maintenance. Using the wrong glass type can compromise the structural integrity or safety performance of the window, increasing the risk of injury to passengers in the event of a collision or breakage.
