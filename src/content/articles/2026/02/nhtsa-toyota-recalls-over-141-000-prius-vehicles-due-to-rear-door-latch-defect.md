### What Happened
Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing is recalling certain Prius vehicles due to a defect in the electrical system's wiring and switches. According to the manufacturer, water may enter the rear door switch and cause a short circuit. This malfunction can allow an unlocked rear door to open unexpectedly.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 141,286 units. The following models and years are included:
- **2023-2024 Toyota Prius Prime**
- **2023-2026 Toyota Prius**
- **2025-2026 Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid**

### What You Should Do
Owners are advised to take their vehicles to an authorized Toyota dealer to have the rear door switch circuits modified. This repair will be performed free of charge. Toyota expects to mail owner notification letters on March 15, 2026. 

Consumers may contact Toyota customer service at 1-800-331-4331. Toyota's internal reference numbers for this recall are **26TB03** and **26TA03**. 

**Note**: This recall expands and replaces NHTSA recall number 24V274. Owners of vehicles that were repaired under the previous recall must still have this new remedy performed.

### Why This Matters
A vehicle door that opens unexpectedly while the car is in motion significantly increases the risk of injury to occupants and poses a safety hazard to others on the road.
