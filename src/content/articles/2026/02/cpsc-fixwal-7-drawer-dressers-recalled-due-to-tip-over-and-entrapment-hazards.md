### What Happened

Momok has issued a recall for Fixwal 7-drawer dressers because the units are unstable if they are not anchored to a wall. This instability poses tip-over and entrapment hazards that can result in serious injury or death to children. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the dressers violate the mandatory safety standards required by the STURDY Act for clothing storage units.

### Which Products Are Affected

The recall involves approximately 2,900 Fixwal 7-Drawer Dressers. The affected products were sold in black and white and feature a metal frame, a wooden top, and seven collapsible fabric drawers. The dressers measure 55.1 inches long by 11.8 inches wide by 31.5 inches tall. These units were sold online at Amazon.com from September 2023 through December 2025 for about $100.

### What You Should Do

Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled dressers if they are not anchored to the wall and place them in an area that children cannot access. To obtain a full refund, consumers should contact Momok by email at fixwaldresserrecall@outlook.com. 

To facilitate the refund, consumers are required to write "RECALLED" on the front, side, and back of the dresser with a permanent marker, take photos of the marked dresser, and email the images to the company.

### Why This Matters

This recall addresses a violation of federal safety standards designed to prevent furniture tip-over incidents, which can be fatal to young children. While no injuries have been reported to date, the entrapment hazard poses a high risk of serious injury.
