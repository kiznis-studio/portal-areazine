### What Happened
Pierce Manufacturing (Pierce) has issued a recall for certain 2025 model year vehicles due to a defect in the steering linkage. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a steering linkage arm bolt may come loose. If this occurs, the steering linkage arm can detach from the steering motor, leading to a failure in the steering system.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall impacts a total of 255 units. The following 2025 Pierce models are included in this action:
*   **Arrow XT**
*   **Enforcer**
*   **Impel**
*   **Saber**
*   **Velocity**

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected vehicles are advised to contact Pierce customer service at 1-888-974-3723 for assistance. Dealers will inspect and tighten the steering linkage arm bolts free of charge. Pierce expects to begin mailing owner notification letters on February 13, 2026.

### Why This Matters
The detachment of the steering linkage arm can result in a sudden loss of steering control. This condition significantly increases the risk of a vehicle crash, posing a danger to the vehicle occupants and others on the road.
