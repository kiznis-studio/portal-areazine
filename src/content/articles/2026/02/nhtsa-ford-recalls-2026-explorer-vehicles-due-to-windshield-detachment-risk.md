### What Happened
Ford Motor Company is recalling certain 2026 Explorer vehicles because the windshields may not have been properly bonded to the vehicle during manufacturing. As a result, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 212, "Windshield Mounting."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects a limited number of vehicles:
- **Product**: 2026 Ford Explorer
- **Quantity**: 8 units
- **Recall Numbers**: NHTSA Campaign Number 26V024000; Ford Recall Number 26C02

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected vehicles are advised to contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332. Ford dealers will remove and replace the windshield free of charge. Owner notification letters were mailed on January 30, 2026. Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) involved in this recall became searchable on the NHTSA website starting January 22, 2026.

### Why This Matters
In the event of a crash, a windshield that is not properly bonded can detach from the vehicle. This detachment significantly increases the risk of injury to the occupants during a collision.
