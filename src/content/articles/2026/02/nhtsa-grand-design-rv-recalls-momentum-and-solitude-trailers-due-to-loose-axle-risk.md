### What Happened
Grand Design RV, LLC has issued a recall for specific fifth-wheel trailers due to a suspension defect. The U-bolts connecting the leaf spring to the axle may become loose because of inadequate preload and preload losses. If these bolts loosen, the axle can move out of its intended position while the vehicle is in motion.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 7,585 units. The following models and years are included in this action:

*   **Grand Design Momentum**: Model years 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024
*   **Grand Design Solitude**: Model years 2022, 2023, and 2024

This recall (NHTSA Campaign Number 26V044000) supersedes previous NHTSA recalls 23V490 and 24V193.

### What You Should Do
The manufacturer is currently developing a remedy for this issue. Grand Design expects to mail interim owner notification letters explaining the safety risks on March 11, 2026. A second notice will be sent to owners once the final remedy is available. 

Owners with questions may contact Grand Design customer service at **1-574-825-9679**. The internal reference number for this recall is **910054**.

### Why This Matters
An axle that shifts out of position can lead to a sudden loss of vehicle control. This malfunction significantly increases the risk of a crash, posing a danger to the driver, passengers, and other motorists.
