### What Happened
A light earthquake with a magnitude of 4.5 (mb) occurred on February 15, 2026, at 14:37:31 UTC. The seismic event was recorded at a depth of 590.6 km, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

### Location Details
The epicenter was located approximately 231 km east of Levuka, Fiji, at coordinates 17.9277°S and 178.5036°W. The depth of 590.6 km classifies this as a deep earthquake. Deep-focus earthquakes (those occurring at depths greater than 70 km) are common in this region but are generally felt less intensely at the surface than shallow events.

### Impact Assessment
At the time of reporting, there have been no felt reports submitted to the USGS. There is no tsunami advisory, watch, or warning in effect for this event. No alert level color has been assigned, and the event is currently listed with a reviewed status.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 4.0 and 4.9 are classified as "light." While they are often noticeable, they rarely cause significant damage, especially when occurring at extreme depths like this event. Residents in seismically active regions should remain aware of safety protocols, though deep-sea events of this nature are routine for the Fiji region.
