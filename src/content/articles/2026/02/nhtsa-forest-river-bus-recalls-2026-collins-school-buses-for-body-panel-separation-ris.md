### What Happened
Forest River Bus, LLC has initiated a recall for certain 2026 Collins school buses due to a manufacturing defect involving the vehicle's structure. The body panel joint adhesive may have been applied to the incorrect location, which can cause the panels to separate. Consequently, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 221, "School Bus Body Joint Strength."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects 213 units of the following vehicle:
*   **Make/Model**: Forest River Bus Collins School Bus
*   **Model Year**: 2026
*   **NHTSA Campaign Number**: 26V041000
*   **Manufacturer Recall Number**: 551-2021

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected school buses are advised to contact Forest River Bus customer service at 1-620-888-3310. Authorized dealers will inspect the vehicles and apply adhesive as necessary to ensure structural integrity. This service will be performed free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed by March 4, 2026.

### Why This Matters
Separated body panels can significantly reduce the structural integrity of the vehicle. In the event of a crash, this defect increases the risk of injury to the bus occupants.
