### What Happened
TIANJINSHIHAOWEIXINSHENGJIDIANANZHUANGGONGCHENG has issued a recall for LShome 3-Pack Smoke Detector Fire Alarms. The sensing threshold of the security warnings may be set too high, which can prevent the alarm from sounding in a timely manner during a fire, posing a fire hazard.

### Which Products Are Affected
This recall involves approximately 11,000 units of the 3-Pack Smoke Detector Fire Alarms. The affected alarms are white, circular, and 9V battery-operated, featuring a test button and a light sound warning. 

Consumers can identify the recalled products by the following identifiers printed on the bottom side of the alarm:
- **Model Number**: XG-7D04-KZ9Z
- **SKU Number**: CX-50YP-A5VN

The products were sold exclusively online at Amazon.com from February 2024 through December 2025 for approximately $30.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled smoke detectors and contact the distributor for a full refund. To initiate the refund process, which will be handled through Amazon.com, consumers should email lmm15957491237@163.com for specific instructions. Once the refund process is initiated, the smoke alarms can be discarded in regular household trash. No injuries have been reported at this time.

### Why This Matters
A smoke detector that fails to alert occupants during a fire poses a significant risk of serious injury or death. Reliable fire detection is critical for household safety and emergency evacuation.
