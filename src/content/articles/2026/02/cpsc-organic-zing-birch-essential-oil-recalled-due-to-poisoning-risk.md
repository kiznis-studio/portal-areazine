### What Happened
Linkers has issued a recall for Organic Zing Birch Oil bottles because the product contains methyl salicylate, a substance that requires child-resistant packaging under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA). The current packaging is not child-resistant, which poses a significant risk of poisoning if a young child swallows the contents.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves approximately 940 units of Organic Zing Birch Oil. The product is packaged in amber glass bottles with black continuous thread caps and features a beige and green label. The front of the bottle displays the Organic Zing logo along with the text "Birch Oil" and "Pure & Natural." The outer box packaging also includes the logo and "Made in India" on the back.

These items were sold online at Amazon.com from January 2024 through November 2025 for approximately $20.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately move the recalled essential oil bottles to a location that is out of the sight and reach of children. To receive a full refund, customers must contact Linkers for instructions on destroying the product. The process involves pouring the bottle's contents into the trash and emailing a photograph of the disposed bottle to admin@linkersecomm.com.

For more information, consumers can contact Linkers at 347-775-2310 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. CT, Monday through Friday, email at admin@linkersecomm.com, or visit us.shoprythm.com and click "Recall" at the top of the page.

### Why This Matters
The lack of child-resistant packaging for substances containing methyl salicylate creates a risk of serious injury or death if ingested by children. While no injuries have been reported to date, the recall is necessary to comply with mandatory federal safety standards.
