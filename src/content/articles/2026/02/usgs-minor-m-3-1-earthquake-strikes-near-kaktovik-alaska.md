A minor earthquake with a magnitude of 3.1 ml was recorded on February 12, 2026, at 19:36:18 UTC (10:36 AM local time). The seismic event occurred at a depth of 74.3 km.

### Location Details
The epicenter was located approximately 65 km south-southwest of Kaktovik, Alaska, at coordinates 69.563°N and 144.042°W. With a recorded depth of 74.3 km, this is classified as a deep earthquake. Deep earthquakes (those occurring at depths greater than 70 km) are typically less likely to cause significant surface shaking compared to shallow events of the same magnitude.

### Impact Assessment

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are classified as minor. While they are often felt by people in the immediate vicinity of the epicenter, they rarely cause structural damage. Residents in seismic zones should always be aware of the possibility of aftershocks and are encouraged to follow standard safety protocols, such as "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" during shaking.
