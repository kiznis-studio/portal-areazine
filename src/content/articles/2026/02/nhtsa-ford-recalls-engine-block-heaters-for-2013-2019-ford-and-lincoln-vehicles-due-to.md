### What Happened
Ford Motor Company has issued a recall for specific engine block heaters sold as accessory parts. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the engine block heater may crack and develop a coolant leak.

These heaters were sold as accessory parts for certain 2013-2019 Ford and Lincoln vehicles equipped with 2.0L engines.

### What You Should Do
Owners are strongly advised not to plug in their engine block heater until the vehicle has been remedied. Ford will contact affected customers with instructions to return the part for a full refund. Alternatively, dealers will replace the block heater with a newly designed part, free of charge, once the new components become available.
