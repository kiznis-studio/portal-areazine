### Current Air Quality
On February 13, 2026, the St. Louis (Metro-east) area in Illinois reported an air quality index (AQI) of 112. The primary pollutant of concern is fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which is currently in the "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" category. Additionally, PM10 levels were measured at an AQI of 21, which is considered "Good."

### What This Means
An AQI level of 112 means that air quality is unhealthy for members of sensitive groups. According to standard EPA categories, this level indicates that while the general public is not likely to be affected, individuals with specific health sensitivities may experience health effects.

### Who Should Take Precautions
Groups at risk include people with heart or lung disease, older adults, children, and teenagers. These individuals are more sensitive to the effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) than the general population.

### What You Should Do
Members of sensitive groups should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. It is advisable to take more breaks and engage in less intense outdoor activities. Monitor for symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath. The general public is not expected to be affected at this AQI level.
