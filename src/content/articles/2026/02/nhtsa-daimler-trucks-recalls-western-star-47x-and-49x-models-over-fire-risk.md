### What Happened
Daimler Trucks North America (DTNA) has issued a recall for certain Western Star trucks due to a defect in the electrical system. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a stud connecting the battery to the starter at the frame rail may have been incorrectly installed or may corrode. This condition can lead to a short circuit.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall impacts approximately 26,958 vehicles. Affected models include:
* **Western Star 49X**: Model years 2020-2027
* **Western Star 47X**: Model years 2021-2027

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected vehicles are advised to contact DTNA customer service at 1-800-547-0712. DTNA's internal identification number for this recall is F1029. 

A remedy for the defect is currently under development. DTNA expects to mail owner notification letters by April 11, 2026. This recall replaces and expands a previous recall (NHTSA number 25V326). Owners are cautioned that vehicles already repaired under the previous recall will still need to have the new remedy completed once it is available.

### Why This Matters
A short circuit in the electrical system significantly increases the risk of a vehicle fire, which poses a serious safety hazard to operators and surrounding property.
