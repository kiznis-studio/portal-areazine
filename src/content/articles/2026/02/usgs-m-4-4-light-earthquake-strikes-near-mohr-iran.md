### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with a magnitude between 4.0 and 4.9 are classified as "light." These events typically cause noticeable shaking and may result in light damage to buildings, though significant structural failure is uncommon. Residents in the vicinity should be aware of the possibility of aftershocks, which are smaller tremors that follow the main earthquake. In the event of further shaking, safety experts recommend that you drop, cover, and hold on.
