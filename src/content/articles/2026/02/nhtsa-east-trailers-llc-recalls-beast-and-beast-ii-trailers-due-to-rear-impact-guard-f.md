### What Happened
East Trailers, LLC has issued a recall for certain trailer models due to a structural defect involving improper welds. These welds may fail, potentially causing the rear impact guard to detach from the vehicle. As a result, these trailers fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) numbers 223, "Rear Impact Guards," and 224, "Rear Impact Protection."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 797 units. The following models are included in this action:
* **Brand:** EAST
* **Models:** Beast and Beast II
* **Model Years:** 2024, 2025, and 2026
* **NHTSA Campaign Number:** 26V007000

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected trailers are advised to contact East Trailers' customer service at 1-574-295-7888. Authorized dealers will repair the weld joint free of charge to ensure the rear impact guard is properly secured. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed by March 14, 2026.

### Why This Matters
Rear impact guards are essential safety features designed to mitigate the impact of a crash and prevent underride. A detached guard cannot perform this function, significantly increasing the risk of injury to occupants of other vehicles in the event of a collision.
