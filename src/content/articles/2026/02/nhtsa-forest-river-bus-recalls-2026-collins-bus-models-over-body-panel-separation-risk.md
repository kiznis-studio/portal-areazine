### What Happened
Forest River Bus, LLC is recalling certain 2026 Collins Bus transit buses due to a manufacturing defect involving the body panel joints. According to the recall report, adhesive may have been applied to the incorrect locations, which can cause the panels to separate. As a result, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 221, "School Bus Body Joint Strength."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects a total of 19 units. The specific model involved is:
*   **Make/Model**: Forest River Bus Collins Bus
*   **Model Year**: 2026

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected transit buses are advised to take their vehicles to an authorized dealer for inspection. Dealers will apply the necessary adhesive to correct the issue free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed by March 4, 2026. 

For further information, owners may contact Forest River Bus customer service at 1-620-888-3310. The Forest River Bus internal reference number for this recall is 551-2023.

### Why This Matters
Separated body panels can significantly reduce the structural integrity of the vehicle. In the event of a crash, this lack of structural strength increases the risk of injury to the bus occupants.
