### What Happened
Honda (American Honda Motor Co.) is recalling specific 2023 and 2024 vehicle models because the driver's seat cushion frame may not have been tightened properly. This manufacturing defect can result in a loose seat, causing the vehicles to fail the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard number 207, "Seating Systems."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects a total of 160 units across the following makes and models:

*   **2023 Honda Accord**
*   **2023 Honda Accord Hybrid**
*   **2024 Honda HR-V**
*   **2024 Honda Pilot**
*   **2024 Acura Integra**

This recall expands upon the previous NHTSA recall number 24V859.

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected vehicles should take their cars to an authorized dealer, where the driver's seat cushion frame will be replaced free of charge. Owner notification letters are scheduled to be mailed on March 9, 2026. 

Consumers may contact Honda's customer service at **1-888-234-2138**. Honda's internal reference numbers for this recall are **ONC, KND, BNE, and ZNF**. Additionally, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) involved in this recall will be searchable on the NHTSA.gov website beginning February 5, 2026.

### Why This Matters
A loose driver's seat may not adequately restrain the driver during a crash, which significantly increases the risk of injury to the occupant.
