### What Happened

SOOWERY is recalling its 6-drawer dressers because they are unstable if not anchored to a wall. This instability poses a risk of tip-over and entrapment, which can lead to serious injury or death, particularly for children. The product violates the mandatory safety standards required by the STURDY Act. No injuries have been reported to date.

### Which Products Are Affected

The recall involves approximately 166 SOOWERY 6-Drawer Dressers sold in black. The units feature a metal frame, a wooden top, and six collapsible fabric drawers. The dressers measure 47.2 inches long by 11.8 inches wide by 33.3 inches tall. These products were sold online at Amazon.com from December 2025 through January 2026 for approximately $130.

### What You Should Do

Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled dressers if they are not anchored to the wall and move them to an area inaccessible to children. To receive a full refund, consumers must use a permanent marker to write the word "recalled" on the top and all sides of the dresser. Contact SOOWERY at SOOWERYrecall@outlook.com for instructions on how to dispose of the unit. Consumers are required to submit a photo to the company showing the disposal of the product to receive their refund.

### Why This Matters

The dressers fail to meet federal stability requirements for clothing storage units, creating a significant risk of fatal entrapment for children if the unit tips over.
