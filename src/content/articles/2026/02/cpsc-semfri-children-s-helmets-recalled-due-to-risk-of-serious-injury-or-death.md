### What Happened
Semfri has issued a recall for its children's multi-purpose helmets because they violate the mandatory federal safety standard for bicycle helmets. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the helmets failed to comply with requirements for impact attenuation, positional stability, labeling, and certification. These failures mean the helmets may not adequately protect a user during a crash.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves approximately 300 Semfri-branded children's multi-purpose helmets. The affected products include:
- **Size**: Medium (M), designed to fit a head circumference of approximately 20.5 to 22.8 inches.
- **Colors**: Orange, black, blue, navy blue, pink, red, and white.
- **Design Features**: All helmets feature black padding, black straps, a black buckle, and a black plastic adjustment knob on the back. The size is printed on a black circular label located inside the helmet.
- **Sales Information**: The helmets were sold online at Walmart.com from June 2025 through November 2025 for between $19 and $28.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled helmets. To receive a full refund, Semfri instructs consumers to destroy the helmet by cutting the straps and emailing a photo of the destroyed helmet to Semfri_recall@163.com. 

### Why This Matters
Because the helmets do not meet federal safety standards, they pose a serious risk of head injury or death in the event of an accident. While no injuries have been reported to date, the failure to meet impact and stability requirements significantly compromises user safety.
