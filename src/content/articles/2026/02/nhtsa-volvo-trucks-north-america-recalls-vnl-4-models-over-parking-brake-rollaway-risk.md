### What Happened
Volvo Trucks North America is recalling certain vehicles that were manufactured without auxiliary parking brakes. According to the manufacturer, if the vehicle is in weight bias mode, there may be insufficient weight on the parking brake axle. This condition can result in inadequate parking brake force, which may not be enough to hold the vehicle stationary.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 3,200 units of the following vehicles:
*   **Brand**: Volvo
*   **Model**: VNL (4)
*   **Model Years**: 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected vehicles are advised to contact Volvo Trucks' customer service at 800-528-6586. Volvo Trucks' internal identification number for this recall is **RVXX2601**. Authorized dealers will replace the brake chambers free of charge to remedy the issue. 

Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed by April 10, 2026. Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) involved in this recall will be searchable on the NHTSA website starting February 17, 2026.

### Why This Matters
Inadequate parking brake force can result in an unintended vehicle rollaway. A rolling vehicle poses a significant safety hazard, increasing the risk of a crash and potential injury to the driver, passengers, or bystanders.
