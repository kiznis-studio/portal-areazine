### What Happened

A moderate earthquake with a magnitude of 5.1 (mb) was recorded on February 14, 2026, at 13:52:05 UTC. The seismic event occurred at a significant depth of 554.9 km, according to data provided by the USGS.

### Location Details

The epicenter was located at coordinates 18.211°S, 178.085°W, approximately 275 km east of Levuka, Fiji. The recorded depth of 554.9 km classifies this as a deep earthquake. Deep-focus earthquakes (those occurring at depths greater than 70 km) are common in the tectonic subduction zones of the South Pacific; because of their depth, they typically cause less shaking at the surface than shallow events of the same magnitude.

### Impact Assessment

There was no tsunami advisory issued in connection with this earthquake. As of the latest report, no felt reports have been submitted to the USGS, and no specific alert level color has been assigned. Given the extreme depth of the event and its location offshore, surface damage is not anticipated.

### What You Should Know

A magnitude 5.1 earthquake is considered a "moderate" event. While earthquakes in the 5.0-5.9 range can cause damage to poorly constructed buildings when they occur near the surface, the depth of over 550 km significantly buffers the impact felt on the ground. Residents in the region should be aware that aftershocks are possible, though deep earthquakes often produce fewer felt aftershocks than shallow ones.
