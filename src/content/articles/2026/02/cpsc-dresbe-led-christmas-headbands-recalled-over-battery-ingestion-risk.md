### What Happened
Wenxi Xuefeng Technology Co., Ltd, doing business as Dresbe, has issued a recall for its LED Christmas Headbands. The products violate mandatory federal safety standards for consumer products containing button cell batteries. The batteries in these headbands can be easily accessed by children, posing a significant ingestion hazard. Additionally, the product and its packaging do not contain the safety warnings required under Reese’s Law.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 250 units of the Dresbe LED Christmas Headbands. These were sold as a two-pack containing one red headband with candy cane attachments and one green headband with a Christmas tree attachment. Each headband uses three button cell batteries to power integrated LED lights.

Consumers can identify the recalled items by the labels on the packaging, which include:
- **Model Number**: HB-052
- **Product Name**: DRESBE LED Christmas Headband (2pc)

The items were sold exclusively online at Amazon.com from March 2024 through June 2025 for approximately $13.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled headbands and move them out of the reach of children. To receive a full refund, contact Dresbe via email at **dresberecall@shineprom.com**. 

To qualify for the refund, consumers must provide a photograph confirming the disposal of the product. Dresbe advises that button cell batteries are hazardous and should be recycled or disposed of in accordance with local hazardous waste procedures rather than placed in standard trash.

### Why This Matters
Button cell batteries pose a severe risk if swallowed, as they can cause internal chemical burns, serious permanent injury, or death in a very short period. While no injuries have been reported to date, the ease of access to the batteries in this product presents a high safety risk to children.
