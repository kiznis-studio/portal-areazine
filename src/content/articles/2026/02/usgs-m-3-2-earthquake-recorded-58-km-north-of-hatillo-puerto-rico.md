### What Happened
A minor earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 md occurred on February 11, 2026, at 18:03:02 UTC. The event has been reviewed by seismologists at the USGS and is classified as a routine seismic event for the region.

### Location Details
The epicenter was located at coordinates 19.018°N, 66.829°W, approximately 58 km north of Hatillo, Puerto Rico. The earthquake originated at a depth of 23.28 km. In geological terms, this is considered an intermediate-depth earthquake (falling within the 20-70 km range), which typically results in less intense surface shaking than shallower events.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are classified as minor. While they are often felt by residents near the epicenter, they rarely cause structural damage. Residents in seismically active areas like Puerto Rico should remain aware that aftershocks are a possibility following any seismic activity. Standard safety protocols recommend that during shaking, individuals should "Drop, Cover, and Hold On."
