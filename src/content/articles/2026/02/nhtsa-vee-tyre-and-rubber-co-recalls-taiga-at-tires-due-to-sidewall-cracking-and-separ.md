### What Happened

Vee Tyre and Rubber Co., Ltd. (Vee Tyre) is recalling certain Taiga AT tires because the lower sidewall and inner liner may crack and separate. This defect means the tires fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 139, which regulates "New Pneumatic Radial Tires for Light Vehicles."

### Which Products Are Affected

The recall involves 144 units of the following product:
- **Brand**: Vee Rubber
- **Model**: Taiga AT (Size LT235/85R16 AT)
- **NHTSA Campaign Number**: 26T006000
- **Manufacturer Recall Number**: 20260116

### What You Should Do

Consumers who own the affected tires should contact Vee Tyre's customer service at 1-212-564-7575. Dealers will replace the affected tires free of charge to resolve the safety issue. Owners may also reference Vee Tyre's specific recall number: 20260116.

### Why This Matters

Tire separation can lead to sudden tire failure and a rapid loss of tire pressure. These conditions significantly increase the risk of a vehicle crash and potential injury.
