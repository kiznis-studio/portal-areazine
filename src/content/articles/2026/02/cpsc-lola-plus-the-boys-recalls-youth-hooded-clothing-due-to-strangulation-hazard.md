### What Happened
Lola Plus The Boys is recalling five styles of youth hooded clothing because the drawstrings can become caught on objects, posing a risk of serious injury or death from strangulation. The products violate the federal safety rule for children's upper outerwear, which prohibits drawstrings in the neck and hood area of such garments.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves approximately 620 units of youth clothing sold in sizes 1 through 12. The brand name "Lola + The Boys" and the size are printed on the neck label. The affected styles include:

*   **Candy Heart Tie Dye set**: Pink and white pants and sweatshirt with yellow beaded drawstrings and a heart on the front.
*   **Hoodie Unicorn Tutu set**: Purple hoodie with a unicorn on the front and a rainbow organza skirt.
*   **Justice League Hero hoodie**: Gray hoodie with a front pocket and superhero decals on the right sleeve.
*   **Emoji Love hoodie**: White sweatshirt with a pocket and three smiley emojis on the front.
*   **Crystal Rainbow Rain hoodie**: Gray hoodie with a front pocket and rainbow-colored beads on the drawstrings.

These items were sold at Lola Plus The Boys stores nationwide and online at Lolaandtheboys.com from November 2022 through September 2025 for between $45 and $80.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately take the recalled clothing away from children and remove the drawstrings to eliminate the hazard. To receive a full refund, consumers should contact Lola Plus The Boys and provide a photo of the clothing with the drawstring removed, along with their name and the date, via email at customerservice@lolaandtheboys.com.

For additional information, consumers can contact Lola Plus The Boys at 312-285-6053 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. CT, Monday through Friday, or visit their website at lolaandtheboys.com and click on "Recall Policy" at the bottom of the homepage.

### Why This Matters
Federal safety standards prohibit drawstrings in children's upper outerwear because they present a substantial risk of strangulation if the drawstring becomes entangled in playground equipment, bus doors, or other moving objects. No injuries have been reported to date.
