### What Happened
Ducati North America has issued a recall for several 2025 and 2026 motorcycle models due to a defect in the hydraulic service brakes. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), excessive heat may damage the rear brake hose situated between the ABS control unit and the brake caliper. This damage can result in a sudden loss of rear brake function.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 1,440 units. The following models and years are included in the recall:

*   **2025-2026 Ducati Streetfighter V4**
*   **2025-2026 Ducati Streetfighter V4 S**
*   **2025-2026 Ducati Panigale V4**
*   **2025-2026 Ducati Panigale V4 S**

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected motorcycles should contact an authorized Ducati dealer to have the thermal shield replaced. This service will be performed free of charge. Ducati expects to mail owner notification letters on March 3, 2026. 

Consumers may contact Ducati customer service at **1-888-391-5446** and reference recall number **SRV-RCL-26-001**. This recall expands and replaces a previous recall (NHTSA number 25V013). Owners who had their vehicles repaired under the previous recall are required to have this new remedy completed as well. Owners can also check their Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on the NHTSA website.

### Why This Matters
A sudden loss of rear brake function while operating a motorcycle significantly increases the risk of a crash, which can lead to serious injury or death.
