## What Happened

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) announced a voluntary recall of approximately 300,000 Fisher-Price Cradle 'n Swing units after receiving reports of two infant deaths and several near-miss incidents involving the product's harness system.

The recall covers multiple Cradle 'n Swing models manufactured between January 2019 and March 2024. The issue involves the swing's restraint buckle, which can loosen during operation, allowing infants to slide into positions that create a suffocation hazard.

## Which Products Are Affected

- **Product:** Fisher-Price Cradle 'n Swing
- **Model numbers:** CMP83, CMP84, CMP85
- **Sold between:** January 2019 – March 2024
- **Sold at:** Target, Walmart, Amazon, Buy Buy Baby, and other major retailers
- **Price range:** $90 – $150
- **Units affected:** Approximately 300,000

You can identify affected units by checking the model number on a label located on the bottom of the swing's seat. A date code is also printed on this label.

## What You Should Do

1. **Stop using the product immediately** — do not continue to use the swing even with supervision
2. **Contact Fisher-Price** for a full refund at **1-800-432-5437** (Mon–Fri, 9am–6pm ET)
3. **Register online** at [fisher-price.com/recalls](https://www.fisher-price.com/recalls) for faster processing
4. **Cut the harness straps** before disposing of the unit to prevent others from using it

Fisher-Price is offering full refunds regardless of the product's condition or whether you have a receipt.

## Why This Matters

This recall affects a significant number of households with young children. The Cradle 'n Swing is one of Fisher-Price's most popular products, widely used for soothing infants during their first year.

The CPSC emphasizes that parents and caregivers should never leave infants unattended in any inclined sleep product, swing, or bouncer. Flat, firm surfaces remain the safest sleep environment for infants.
