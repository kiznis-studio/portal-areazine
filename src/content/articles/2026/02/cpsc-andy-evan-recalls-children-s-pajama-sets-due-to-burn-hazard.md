### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled pajama sets and keep them away from children.

### Why This Matters
Federal flammability standards for children's sleepwear are strictly enforced to protect children from fire-related injuries. Garments that do not meet these standards pose a significant safety risk if they come into contact with an ignition source.
