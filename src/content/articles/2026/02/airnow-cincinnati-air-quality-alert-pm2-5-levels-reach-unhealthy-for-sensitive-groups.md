### Current Air Quality

On February 14, 2026, the reporting area of Cincinnati, OH, recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 120. The primary pollutant of concern is fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which has reached the "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" category. Other pollutants measured in the area include Ozone (O3) with an AQI of 21 (Good) and PM10 with an AQI of 19 (Good).

### What This Means

An AQI of 120 indicates that air quality is unhealthy for members of sensitive groups. At this level, the general public is less likely to be affected, but individuals with specific health conditions may experience health effects from breathing fine particles.

### What You Should Do

Members of sensitive groups should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. It is recommended to take more breaks and engage in less intense outdoor activities. Watch for symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath. The general public can continue their outdoor activities as usual.
