## Current Air Quality

On February 11, 2026, the EPA reported that the New York City Region, NY, is experiencing air quality levels classified as "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups." The primary pollutant of concern is fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which has reached an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 107. Ozone (O3) levels in the area were also measured at an AQI of 26, which is categorized as "Good."

## What This Means

An AQI level of 107 indicates that air quality is unhealthy for sensitive groups. At this level, members of sensitive groups may experience health effects, though the general public is less likely to be affected.

## Who Should Take Precautions

Groups at higher risk from exposure to PM2.5 include people with heart or lung disease, older adults, children, and teenagers. These individuals should be mindful of their outdoor activity levels while this alert is in effect.

## What You Should Do

People in sensitive groups should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors. It is advisable to take more breaks, engage in less intense activities, and watch for symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath. The general public is not expected to be affected and can continue normal outdoor activities.
