### Alert Details
The National Weather Service in Sacramento has issued a Winter Storm Warning for multiple regions in Northern California. The alert is effective starting Sunday night and is scheduled to remain in place until late Wednesday evening.

### Affected Areas
The warning covers a broad geographic area including:

* **Foothills and Coastal Range**: Northeast Foothills, the Motherlode, and the Mountains from Southwestern Shasta County to Western Colusa County.

Travel is expected to be dangerous to near impossible during the peak of the storm. Residents and travelers should prepare for chain controls and potential road closures. Before traveling, check the latest road conditions via Caltrans at quickmap.dot.ca.gov or by dialing 5-1-1. Low visibility due to blowing snow will make driving hazardous.
