### What Happened
Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird) has initiated a recall for certain school bus models due to a non-compliance issue with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 205, "Glazing Materials." The affected vehicles may have side or rear windows with illegible DOT markings.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves approximately 1,728 units. The following models and years are included:
*   **2026-2027 Blue Bird All American School Bus**
*   **2026-2027 Blue Bird Vision School Bus**

### What You Should Do
The remedy for this issue is currently under development. Blue Bird expects to mail notification letters to vehicle owners on March 20, 2026. Owners may contact Blue Bird customer service at 1-478-822-2242 for more information regarding this recall.

### Why This Matters
If a window lacks a legible DOT code mark, it may eventually be replaced with an incorrect type of glass during maintenance or repair. Using improper glazing materials in a school bus increases the risk of injury to passengers in the event of a collision or glass breakage.
