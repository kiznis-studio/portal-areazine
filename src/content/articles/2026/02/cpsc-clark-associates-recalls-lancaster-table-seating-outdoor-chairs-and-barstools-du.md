### What Happened
Clark Associates is recalling several models of outdoor seating because the legs of the chairs and barstools can bend or break while in use. This structural failure poses a significant fall hazard to consumers. To date, the firm has received 36 reports of broken or bent chair legs, which have resulted in four falls and three reported injuries.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves approximately 158,486 units of Lancaster Table & Seating Powder-Coated Aluminum Outdoor Chairs and Barstools. The affected products include three configurations: arm chairs, side chairs (no arms), and barstools. 

These items were sold in 12 colors: blue, brown, dark gray, light gray/silver, red, white, aqua, black, green, sangria/burgundy, yellow, and orange. The recall covers 180 specific item numbers, which can be found on original order confirmation emails, shipping confirmations, and invoices. The products were sold nationwide through Clark Pro, Clark National Accounts, and online at webstaurantstore.com, therestaurantstore.com, and quicksupply.com from April 2020 through October 2025 for between $55 and $133.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled chairs and barstools. To receive a full refund to the original method of purchase or a store credit, consumers must register their product online at the Lancaster Table & Seating recall website. 

Owners are instructed to mark the product with the word "Recalled" in a visible location using paint or a thick permanent marker and then dispose of the product in accordance with local and state laws. For more information, contact Clark Associates toll-free at 800-285-8172 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET Monday through Friday, or via email at pcachairsandbarstools@lancastertableandseating.com.

### Why This Matters
This recall is significant because the structural instability of the chair legs has already led to multiple incidents of breakage and physical injury to users.
