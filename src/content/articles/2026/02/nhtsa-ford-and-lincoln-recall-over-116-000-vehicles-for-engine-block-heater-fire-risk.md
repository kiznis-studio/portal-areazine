### What Happened
Ford Motor Company has issued a recall for specific vehicle models equipped with 2.0L engines due to a defect in the engine block heater. The heater may crack and develop a coolant leak, which can lead to an electrical short circuit when the block heater is plugged into an electrical outlet.

Owners are advised not to plug in their engine block heaters until the vehicle has been repaired. Ford dealers will replace the engine block heater free of charge. 

Interim notification letters informing owners of the safety risk are expected to be mailed by February 13, 2026. A second letter will be sent once the final remedy is available, which is anticipated in April 2026. Owners may contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332.
