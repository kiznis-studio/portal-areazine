### What Happened
Alexis Fire Equipment Company (Alexis Fire) has issued a recall for specific tanker trucks due to a defect in the suspension system. The axle clamp fasteners on these vehicles may be loose. If these fasteners are not properly secured, it can result in a loss of vehicle control, significantly increasing the risk of a crash.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves two units of Alexis Fire Equipment Fire Apparatus tanker trucks built on Freightliner M2 chassis. The affected vehicles include:
- **Model Year 2022 Alexis Fire Equipment Fire Apparatus**
- **Model Year 2024 Alexis Fire Equipment Fire Apparatus**

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected vehicles should contact an authorized Daimler Truck North America LLC (DTNA) service facility. Dealers will inspect the axle clamp fasteners and tighten them as necessary, free of charge. 

Owner notification letters were mailed on January 28, 2026. Owners with questions may contact DTNA customer service at 1-800-547-0712 or Alexis Fire customer service at 1-309-482-6121. When contacting DTNA, refer to recall number F1027. Owners may also reference NHTSA campaign number 26V029000.

### Why This Matters
Loose critical fasteners in a vehicle's suspension system can lead to unpredictable handling or a total loss of steering control. In heavy fire apparatus and tanker trucks, this poses a severe safety risk to both the operators and other motorists.
