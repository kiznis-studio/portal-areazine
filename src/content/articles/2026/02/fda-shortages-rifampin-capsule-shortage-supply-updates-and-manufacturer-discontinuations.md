### What Patients Should Do
If you are currently prescribed Rifampin, it is important to check your supply and speak with your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Because some package sizes (NDCs) are still available while others are discontinued, your pharmacy may need to source a different package size than what you have previously received.

*   **Consult your healthcare provider:** Discuss your treatment plan and ensure you have a continuous supply of medication.
*   **Speak with your pharmacist:** They can check current stock levels and verify which presentations are currently in stock.
*   **Contact the manufacturer:** For specific supply questions, you can reach Epic Pharma, LLC at (718) 276-8600 ext. 3.
