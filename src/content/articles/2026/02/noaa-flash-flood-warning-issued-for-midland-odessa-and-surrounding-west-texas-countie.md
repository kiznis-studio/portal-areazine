### Alert Details
The National Weather Service in Midland/Odessa has issued a Flash Flood Warning for several counties in western Texas. The alert was issued at 10:18 PM CST on February 13, 2026, and is effective immediately.

### Affected Areas

### What You Should Do
Residents and motorists are advised to "Turn around, don't drown" when encountering flooded roads. Most flood-related fatalities occur in vehicles. Use extreme caution while traveling at night, as the dangers of flooding are significantly harder to recognize in the dark. Avoid low-lying areas, underpasses, and urban streets where water may collect quickly.

### Expected Conditions
According to Doppler radar, thunderstorms are currently producing heavy rain across the warned area. Meteorological data indicates that between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain has already fallen. Additional rainfall amounts of up to 1 inch are possible. 

Hazards include flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets, and underpasses, as well as other poor drainage and low-lying areas. Flash flooding is either currently ongoing or expected to begin shortly.

### Timeline
The Flash Flood Warning is in effect from 10:18 PM CST on Friday, February 13, 2026, until 1:30 AM CST on Saturday, February 14, 2026.
