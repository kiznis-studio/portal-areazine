### What Happened
Little Cow Company has initiated a recall of its 9 oz candles because the glass jars holding the wax can crack or break while in use. This defect poses significant fire, burn, and laceration hazards. To date, the firm has received two reports of the glass jars breaking, though no injuries have been reported.

### Which Products Are Affected
This recall involves approximately 1,140 "Little Cow Co." candles. The affected products are 9 oz glass jars featuring screw-top lids. 

**Identification Details:**
*   **Brand Name:** "Little Cow Co." located on a sticker in the center of the front of the jar.
*   **Label Text:** The sticker also states, "100% natural soy wax candle, laced with organic butter."
*   **Sales Period:** The candles were sold from December 2025 through January 2026 for approximately $25.
*   **Retailers:** Sold at New Seasons Market and Town and Country stores nationwide.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled candles. To receive a full refund, the manufacturer requires consumers to perform the following steps:
1. Use a permanent marker to draw an "X" on the glass container.
2. Cut the candle wicks.
3. Email a photo of the marked jar and the cut wicks to Little Cow Company at **info@littlecowco.com**.

### Why This Matters
The recall is significant because the failure of the glass container while a candle is lit can lead to unintended fires or cause physical injury through burns or cuts from broken glass.
