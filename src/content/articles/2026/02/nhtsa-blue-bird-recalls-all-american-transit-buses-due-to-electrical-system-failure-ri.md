### What Happened

Blue Bird Body Company has initiated a recall for certain electric transit buses due to a defect in the electrical system. According to the manufacturer, a 12-volt cable in these vehicles may be loose and could potentially disconnect. If the cable disconnects, it can cause a sudden loss of various electrical systems while the vehicle is in operation.

### Which Products Are Affected

The recall impacts a total of 48 units. The specific models affected are:

*   **Brand**: Blue Bird
*   **Model**: All American Transit Bus (Electric)
*   **Model Years**: 2022, 2023, and 2024
*   **NHTSA Campaign Number**: 26V002000

### What You Should Do

Owners of the affected vehicles are encouraged to contact Blue Bird customer service at 1-478-822-2242 for assistance. Authorized dealers will perform an inspection of the 12-volt cable, add a torque stripe, and properly tighten the cable as necessary. These repairs will be completed free of charge. Owner notification letters are scheduled to be mailed out by February 17, 2026.

### Why This Matters

The disconnection of the 12-volt cable can lead to a loss of drive power, instrument panel displays, and critical safety features such as brake assist and steering assist. The failure of these systems while the bus is in motion significantly increases the risk of a crash.
