### What Happened
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA) has issued a recall for several EQB model vehicles due to a defect in the high voltage battery system. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the high voltage battery may fail internally, which can lead to a vehicle fire. This risk exists both while the vehicle is being driven and when it is parked.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 11,895 units. The following models and years are included:
*   **2023-2024 Mercedes-Benz EQB 250+**
*   **2022-2024 Mercedes-Benz EQB 300 4MATIC**
*   **2022-2024 Mercedes-Benz EQB 350 4MATIC**

This recall (NHTSA Campaign Number 26V073000) replaces previous recalls 25V050 and 25V894. Owners of vehicles previously repaired under those recalls must have the new remedy completed.

### What You Should Do
Owners are advised to **park their vehicles outside and away from structures** until the recall repair has been performed. Additionally, MBUSA recommends that owners **only charge their vehicles to a maximum of 80% battery capacity** until the remedy is available.

Dealers will replace the high voltage battery free of charge. Interim notification letters are expected to be mailed to owners on February 27, 2026, with a second letter to follow once the final remedy is ready. Owners may contact MBUSA customer service at 1-800-367-6372. Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) will be searchable on the NHTSA website starting February 13, 2026.

### Why This Matters
A vehicle fire occurring while parked or driving significantly increases the risk of injury to occupants and can cause damage to nearby property or structures.
