### What Happened
A minor earthquake with a magnitude of 3.46 ml was recorded on Wednesday, February 11, 2026, at 01:39 UTC (Tuesday, February 10, 2026, at 5:39 PM local time). The seismic event occurred at an extremely shallow depth of 0.35 km.

### Location Details
The epicenter was located offshore at coordinates 40.408°N, 125.119°W, approximately 71 km (44 miles) west of Petrolia, California. The depth of 0.35 km is categorized as shallow. Shallow earthquakes, defined as those occurring at depths of less than 20 km, are generally more likely to be felt by people on the surface than deeper events, though their impact is heavily dependent on magnitude.

### Impact Assessment
At the time of reporting, there are no felt reports submitted to the USGS for this event. There is no tsunami advisory, watch, or warning in effect. No alert level color was assigned to this event, indicating it is considered routine seismic activity for the region.

### What You Should Know
This event is classified as a "minor earthquake." Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are frequently recorded in California; while they are often felt by those near the epicenter, they rarely cause structural damage. Residents are reminded that aftershocks are possible following any seismic event. The standard safety response during shaking is to "Drop, Cover, and Hold On."
