### What Happened
Polestar Automotive USA, Inc. (Polestar) has issued a recall for certain 2025 Polestar 3 vehicles due to a defect in the seating system. The striker brackets that secure the rear seat backrest may be loose. Consequently, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 207, "Seating Systems."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects the following vehicles:
*   **Make/Model**: Polestar 3
*   **Model Year**: 2025
*   **Total Units Affected**: 213

### What You Should Do
Owners of affected vehicles should take their car to an authorized dealer for a free repair. Dealers will inspect the rear seat backrest striker bracket mounting nuts and tighten them as necessary. 

Polestar expects to mail owner notification letters on March 22, 2026. Consumers may contact Polestar customer service at 1-800-806-2504 and reference recall number **RP1079**. Additionally, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) involved in this recall will be searchable on the NHTSA.gov website beginning January 30, 2026.

### Why This Matters
A loose rear seat backrest may fall forward during a collision. This failure can allow cargo from the rear of the vehicle to enter the cabin, increasing the risk of injury to the driver and passengers.
