## What Happened

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has issued a recall for approximately 180,000 Toyota Camry sedans from the 2022–2024 model years due to a defect in the driver-side airbag inflator. The issue can prevent the airbag from deploying correctly during a frontal collision.

Toyota identified the problem through warranty claims and internal quality audits. A faulty sensor in the steering column module can fail to transmit the crash signal to the airbag control unit.

## Which Vehicles Are Affected

- **Make/Model:** Toyota Camry (LE, SE, XLE, XSE, TRD trims)
- **Model years:** 2022, 2023, 2024
- **Manufacturing dates:** March 2021 – September 2023
- **Units affected:** Approximately 180,000

To check if your specific vehicle is affected, enter your VIN at [nhtsa.gov/recalls](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls) or call Toyota at **1-800-331-4331**.

## What You Should Do

1. **Check your VIN** at the NHTSA recall lookup tool
2. **Contact your Toyota dealer** to schedule a free repair
3. **Continue driving** — Toyota and NHTSA have assessed the risk and determined it is safe to drive while awaiting repair, though you should schedule service as soon as possible
4. **The repair is free** — Toyota will replace the steering column sensor module at no cost

Toyota dealers are expected to have replacement parts available starting March 2026. Notification letters will be mailed to registered owners.

## Why This Matters

The Toyota Camry is consistently one of the best-selling vehicles in the United States. This recall affects a wide number of drivers across the country. While no crashes or injuries related to this defect have been confirmed, the failure of a driver-side airbag represents a significant safety risk.
