### What Happened
Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing (Toyota) has initiated a recall for specific rear combination light assemblies sold as replacement parts. These components may be equipped with a side marker reflector instead of the required side marker light. Consequently, these parts fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 108, which governs "Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 79 units of the following replacement parts intended for Toyota bZ4X vehicles:
*   **Product:** Rear Combination Light Assemblies (Right Hand and Left Hand)
*   **Part Numbers:** 81561-42290 and 81551-42290
*   **NHTSA Campaign Number:** 26E005000
*   **Toyota Recall Numbers:** 26TK01 and 26TH01

### What You Should Do
Toyota will notify owners of the affected parts, with letters expected to be mailed by March 10, 2026. Dealers will inspect the rear combination light assemblies and replace them as necessary, free of charge. Consumers may contact Toyota customer service at 1-800-331-4331 for more information regarding this recall.

### Why This Matters
If a vehicle is not equipped with the correct side marker lights, it may be difficult for other road users to see the vehicle from the rear or side. This reduced visibility increases the risk of a crash, particularly in low-light conditions.
