### What Happened
Chrysler (FCA US, LLC) has issued a recall for specific Jeep Grand Cherokee models due to a suspension defect. The rear coil springs may have been incorrectly installed, which could lead to them detaching from the vehicle while it is being driven.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 80,620 units. The following models are included in this action:
*   **2021-2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee L**
*   **2022-2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee**

This recall (NHTSA campaign number 26V051000) replaces the previous NHTSA recall number 23V413. Owners of vehicles that were already repaired under the previous recall will still need to have this new remedy completed.

### What You Should Do
Dealers will inspect and repair the rear coil spring assembly free of charge. Chrysler expects to mail interim notification letters to owners by February 12, 2026. A second notice will be sent once the final remedy is available, which is anticipated in March 2026.

Owners may contact FCA US, LLC customer service at **1-800-853-1403**. The manufacturer's internal number for this recall is **20D**. Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) became searchable on the NHTSA website starting January 30, 2026.

### Why This Matters
If rear coil springs detach from a vehicle while it is in motion, it significantly increases the risk of a crash and creates a potential hazard for other drivers on the road.
