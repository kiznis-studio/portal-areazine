### What Happened
Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird) has issued a recall for specific 2026 transit buses equipped with QRT-Deluxe and QRT-Max wheelchair restraints. The retractors in these restraint systems may fail to lock, which prevents wheelchairs from being properly secured to the vehicle floor.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 22 units in total. The following models are included in the recall:

*   **2026 Blue Bird Vision Transit Bus (Electric)**
*   **2026 Blue Bird All American Transit Bus (Electric)**

### What You Should Do
Blue Bird will work with Q'Straint to inspect the affected vehicles and replace the wheelchair retractors as necessary. These repairs will be performed free of charge. Owner notification letters were mailed on January 29, 2026. Owners may contact Blue Bird customer service directly at 1-478-822-2242 for more information regarding this recall.

### Why This Matters
If a wheelchair is not properly secured, it can move unexpectedly during transit. This movement increases the risk of injury to the wheelchair occupant and other passengers on the bus.
