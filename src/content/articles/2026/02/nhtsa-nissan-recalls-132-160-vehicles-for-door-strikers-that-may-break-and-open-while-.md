### What Happened
Nissan North America, Inc. is recalling over 132,000 vehicles because the door strikers may have been improperly welded. This manufacturing defect can cause the strikers to break, which may allow a vehicle door to open while the car is in motion. Consequently, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 206, which governs "Door Locks and Door Retention Components."

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 132,160 units in total. The following Nissan models are included:
*   **2025 Nissan Altima**
*   **2025 Nissan Sentra**
*   **2025-2026 Nissan Frontier**
*   **2026 Nissan Kicks**

### What You Should Do
Nissan will notify owners by mail, with letters expected to be sent out on March 13, 2026. Authorized dealers will replace the door strikers on affected vehicles free of charge. Owners may contact Nissan customer service at 800-647-7261 and reference recall numbers **PD185** or **PMA61**. Additionally, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) involved in this recall will be searchable on the NHTSA website starting January 28, 2026.

### Why This Matters
A door that opens unexpectedly while a vehicle is in motion significantly increases the risk of a crash or injury to the vehicle's occupants.
