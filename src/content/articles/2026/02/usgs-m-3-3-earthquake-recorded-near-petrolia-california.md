### Location Details

The earthquake was centered at coordinates 40.348°N and 124.382°W. The event originated at a depth of 16.56 kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at depths less than 20 kilometers are classified as shallow; these events can sometimes result in shaking being more noticeable to those nearby compared to deeper seismic activity.

### What You Should Know

Earthquakes with magnitudes between 2.5 and 3.9 are classified as minor. While these events are often felt by people near the epicenter, they rarely cause structural damage. Residents in seismic zones are encouraged to remain prepared and follow standard safety protocols, such as "Drop, Cover, and Hold On," during shaking.
