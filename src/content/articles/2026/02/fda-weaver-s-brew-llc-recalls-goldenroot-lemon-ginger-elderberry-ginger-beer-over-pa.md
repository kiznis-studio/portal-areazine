### What Happened
Weaver's Brew LLC has initiated a voluntary recall of its Goldenroot Lemon Ginger Elderberry Ginger Beer. The recall was triggered because the ginger juice used in the beverage may not have undergone the required pasteurization process, which is a critical safety step in food production.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves 1,066 cases of the following product:

*   **Product Name**: Goldenroot Lemon Ginger Elderberry Ginger Beer
*   **Size**: 12 oz. (355 ml)
*   **UPC**: 8 50052-32818 4
*   **Code Information**: All "Use By" dates up to 6/14/26
*   **Distribution**: The affected products were distributed in the states of Texas and California.

### What You Should Do
Consumers who have purchased Goldenroot Lemon Ginger Elderberry Ginger Beer are advised to check the UPC and "Use By" dates on the packaging. If the product matches the recalled criteria, it should not be consumed. While the FDA has classified this recall as terminated, consumers should remain vigilant regarding any remaining stock that matches the affected description.

### Why This Matters
Pasteurization is necessary to eliminate potentially harmful pathogens in juice-based products. This Class II recall indicates that the product may pose a health hazard, although the probability of serious adverse health consequences is considered remote.
