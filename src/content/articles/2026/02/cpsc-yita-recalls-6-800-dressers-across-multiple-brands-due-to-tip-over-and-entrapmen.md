### What Happened
YITA has issued a recall for approximately 6,800 dressers across five different brand names due to instability and tip-over hazards. The dressers are unstable if they are not anchored to a wall, posing a risk of serious injury or death from entrapment, particularly to children. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), these products violate the mandatory safety standards required by the STURDY Act.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall involves 16-drawer dressers sold under the following brand names: **Dextrus, ModFusion, Uforic, Yintatech, and Yitahome**. 

The affected units feature a black or white metal frame, a wooden top, and collapsible fabric drawers. They were sold in gray, black, white, pink, and brown, measuring approximately 37.4 inches long, 11.8 inches wide, and 57.1 inches tall. 

Consumers can identify the recalled products by the following SKU numbers printed on labels on the dresser's top panel and the product packaging:
* FTBFSD-0161
* FTBFSD-0162
* FTBFSD-0212
* FTBFSD-0246
* FTBFSD-0465

These dressers were sold online at Amazon.com and Walmart.com from September 2023 through August 2025 for between $75 and $100.

### What You Should Do
Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled dressers if they are not anchored to the wall and move them to an area that children cannot access. 

To receive a full refund, consumers must:
1. Write "RECALL" on the dresser using a permanent marker.
2. Disassemble the unit.
3. Submit a photo of the disposed/disassembled product to yitamotor@outlook.com.

For more information, contact YITA toll-free at 877-672-0878 from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. ET Monday through Friday, or visit [yitahome.com](https://www.yitahome.com/) and click "Recall" at the top of the page.

### Why This Matters
While no injuries have been reported to date, the dressers fail to meet federal stability requirements. Tip-over incidents involving heavy furniture can lead to permanent injury or death, especially for young children who may attempt to climb on the drawers.
