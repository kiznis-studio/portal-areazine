### What Happened

A moderate magnitude 5.5 (mb) earthquake struck the region near Khuzdar, Pakistan, on Sunday, February 15, 2026, at 06:30:22 UTC. The seismic event was recorded by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and is classified as a moderate earthquake, which has the potential to cause damage to poorly constructed buildings.

### Location Details

The earthquake was centered approximately 79 km (49 miles) northeast of Khuzdar, Pakistan. The epicenter was located at coordinates 28.3204°N and 67.1802°E. The event occurred at a depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). This is considered a shallow earthquake; seismic events occurring at depths of less than 20 kilometers are often felt more intensely at the surface than deeper events.

### Impact Assessment

According to the USGS, the earthquake reached a Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) of 6.665. The PAGER (Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response) system issued a "green" alert level, indicating a low likelihood of casualties and economic damage. There is no tsunami advisory, watch, or warning in effect for this event. No felt reports were officially recorded in the initial source data.

### What You Should Know

A magnitude 5.5 earthquake is considered a "moderate" event. While it can be felt over a wide area, significant damage is generally limited to poorly constructed structures. Residents in the region should remain aware of the possibility of aftershocks. During seismic activity, safety officials recommend that you "Drop, Cover, and Hold On."
