### What Happened
Ford Motor Company has issued a recall for certain vehicles equipped with engine block heaters. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the engine block heater in these vehicles may crack and develop a coolant leak. This defect can cause an electrical short circuit when the block heater is plugged into a power source.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 12,015 units in total. The specific models and years included are:
*   **2016-2018 Ford Focus**
*   **2019 Ford Explorer**
*   **2024 Ford Explorer**

This action expands upon a previous recall (number 25V685). Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) for the affected units became searchable on the NHTSA website on January 16, 2026.

### What You Should Do
Owners are advised **not to plug in their engine block heater** until the vehicle has been repaired. Ford dealers will replace the engine block heater free of charge. 

Interim notification letters informing owners of the safety risk are expected to be mailed by February 13, 2026. A second round of letters will be sent once the final remedy is available, which is anticipated in April 2026. Owners may contact Ford customer service at **1-866-436-7332**. Ford's internal reference number for this recall is **25SA4**.

### Why This Matters
An electrical short circuit resulting from a coolant leak in the engine block heater significantly increases the risk of a vehicle fire while the heater is in use.
