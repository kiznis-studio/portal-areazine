### What Happened
Zero Motorcycles Inc. (Zero) has issued a recall for several 2024-2025 motorcycle models due to a defect in the front brake assembly. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the front brake hose may be twisted and become damaged over time. This damage can lead to a brake fluid leak, resulting in a loss of hydraulic brake pressure.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects approximately 944 units in total. The following models and years are included in the recall:

*   **2024-2025 Zero DS**
*   **2024-2025 Zero DSR**
*   **2024-2025 Zero DSRP**
*   **2024-2025 Zero DSR/X**

### What You Should Do
Owners of the affected motorcycles are advised to contact Zero customer service at **1-888-841-8085**. Zero's internal reference number for this recall is **SV-RCL-025-017.2**. 

Authorized dealers will inspect the front brake hose and replace it if necessary at no cost to the owner. Notification letters are expected to be mailed to owners by February 23, 2026. Additionally, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) involved in this recall are expected to be searchable on the NHTSA website starting February 27, 2026.

### Why This Matters
A loss of brake pressure can significantly reduce a rider's ability to slow or stop the motorcycle. This loss of braking performance can lead to a loss of vehicle control, which increases the risk of a crash and potential injury.
