### What Happened
Haleon US Holdings LLC has initiated a voluntary Class III recall of parodontax Active Gum Health mouthwash. The recall was prompted by a labeling issue where the lot number and expiration date coding on the bottles may be missing or illegible.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall affects 84,764 bottles of mouthwash distributed nationwide in the United States. The specific product details are as follows:

*   **Product Name**: parodontax (cetylpyridinium chloride) ACTIVE GUM HEALTH, Mouthwash, Mint
*   **Size**: 16.9 FL OZ (500 mL)
*   **NDC**: 0135-0651-02
*   **Lot Number**: 0665363
*   **Expiration Date**: 08/31/2027
*   **Recall Number**: D-0297-2026

### What You Should Do
Consumers who have purchased parodontax Active Gum Health mouthwash should check the packaging for a visible lot number and expiration date. If this information is missing or cannot be read, consumers can contact the recalling firm, Haleon US Holdings LLC, based in Warren, New Jersey, for further instructions regarding the affected product.

### Why This Matters
This recall is classified as Class III, indicating that the use of the product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. However, the absence of legible lot and expiration data prevents consumers and the manufacturer from accurately tracking the product's shelf life and identifying specific units in the event of future quality concerns.
