### What Happened

Allwin Powersports Corp. (APC) is recalling certain LS2 Rebellion motorcycle helmets because they may lack proper impact protection. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), these helmets fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 218, "Motorcycle Helmets."

### Which Products Are Affected

The recall affects LS2 Rebellion helmets in sizes **XL** and **XXL**. The units involved were manufactured between **July 1, 2024, and July 30, 2025**. A total of 3,714 units are included in this recall campaign.

### What You Should Do

APC will provide a replacement helmet to affected owners free of charge. Consumers who own these helmets should contact Allwin Powersports Corp. customer service for further instructions. APC can be reached by phone at **(630) 236-2366** or **(888) 968-9888**.

### Why This Matters

A helmet that fails to provide adequate impact protection does not meet federal safety requirements and significantly increases the risk of serious injury to the wearer during a crash.
