### What Happened

Daimler Coaches North America (Daimler Coaches) has issued a recall for certain 2026 Mercedes-Benz transit buses due to a defect in the door control system. The door control valve may fail to release the self-holding mechanism, which can prevent the door from opening.

### Which Products Are Affected

The recall affects approximately 102 units in total. The following models are included:

*   **Make/Model**: 2026 Mercedes-Benz Tourrider Business
*   **Make/Model**: 2026 Mercedes-Benz Tourrider Premium

### What You Should Do

Daimler Coaches will replace the door control valve on affected vehicles free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed by April 3, 2026. Owners may contact Daimler Coaches customer service at 1-416-624-3558. The manufacturer's internal number for this recall is 72.40U26365A.

### Why This Matters

A door that cannot be opened can prevent or delay passengers from evacuating the bus during an emergency, significantly increasing the risk of injury to occupants.
