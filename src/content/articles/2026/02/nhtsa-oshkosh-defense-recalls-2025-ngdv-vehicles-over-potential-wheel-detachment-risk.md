### What Happened
Oshkosh Corporation (Oshkosh Defense) has issued a recall for certain 2025 model year vehicles due to a mechanical defect in the wheel assembly. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the rear axle hub fasteners on these vehicles may loosen over time. If the fasteners become sufficiently loose, the wheel may detach from the vehicle.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall impacts a total of 80 units. The following models are included in this action:
*   **2025 OSHKOSH NGDV**
*   **2025 OSHKOSH NGDV ELECTRIC**

### What You Should Do
Oshkosh Defense will notify affected owners by mail, with letters expected to be sent out by January 30, 2026. To remedy the issue, Oshkosh Defense will replace and properly tighten the hub fasteners at no cost to the owner. 

Owners with questions may contact Oshkosh Defense customer service at **1-833-304-8100**. When calling, refer to the Oshkosh Defense recall number **NGDV_TSB_057** or the NHTSA campaign number **26V027000**.

### Why This Matters
A detached wheel during operation can lead to an immediate loss of vehicle control. Furthermore, a detached wheel becomes a significant road hazard for other motorists, substantially increasing the risk of a crash.
