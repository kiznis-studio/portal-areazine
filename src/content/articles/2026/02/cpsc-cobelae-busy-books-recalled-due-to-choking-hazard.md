### What Happened
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has announced a recall of Cobelae Busy Books due to a violation of the federal small parts ban. The beads attached to the "apple" illustration on page eight of the book can loosen and detach, posing a serious choking hazard to young children.

This recall involves approximately 3,500 units of the **Cobelae Busy Book for Toddlers**, specifically model **2025-Q3-0702**. 

Product details include:

- **Specific Feature**: An apple-themed illustration on page eight includes a string of beads.
- **Markings**: There are no other markings or labels on the book.
- **Sales Information**: The books were sold online at Amazon.com by Flyindream from October 2025 through November 2025 for approximately $26.

### What You Should Do
