### What Happened
A light earthquake with a magnitude of 4.4 mb occurred on February 10, 2026, at 5:34 PM UTC (17:34:14). The seismic event was recorded at a significant depth of 516.3 kilometers.

### Location Details
The earthquake's epicenter was positioned at coordinates 18.1243°S and 178.262°W. This location is approximately 256 km east of Levuka, Fiji. Given its depth of over 516 km, this is classified as a deep earthquake. Deep-focus earthquakes occur at depths greater than 70 km and are often the result of tectonic plates subducting deep into the Earth's mantle.

### Impact Assessment
According to the USGS, there have been no felt reports submitted by the public for this event. There is no tsunami advisory, watch, or warning in effect (tsunami: 0). No specific alert level color has been assigned to this event, and the status is currently listed as "reviewed."

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with a magnitude between 4.0 and 4.9 are considered "light." While they are often noticeable when they occur at shallower depths, deep-focus earthquakes like this one are rarely felt at the surface and typically do not cause damage. Residents in the region should remain informed but can consider this a routine geological event for the Fiji area.
