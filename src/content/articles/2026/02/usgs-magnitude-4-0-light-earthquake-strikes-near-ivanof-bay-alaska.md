### What Happened
A light earthquake with a magnitude of 4.0 ml occurred on February 18, 2026, at 03:36 UTC. The seismic event was recorded at a depth of 197.8 km. In local time, the earthquake occurred on February 17, 2026, at 6:36 PM AKST.

### Location Details
The earthquake's epicenter was located at coordinates 56.366°N, 160.104°W, approximately 64 km northwest of Ivanof Bay, Alaska. At 197.8 km, this is classified as a deep earthquake. Deep earthquakes (those occurring at depths greater than 70 km) are typically felt over a wider area but are significantly less likely to cause surface damage compared to shallow events.

### Impact Assessment
According to the USGS, there are currently no felt reports associated with this event. The Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) is rated at 1, indicating no perceived shaking. No tsunami advisory, watch, or warning has been issued in connection with this earthquake. There is no alert level color assigned to this event in the source data.

### What You Should Know
Earthquakes with a magnitude between 4.0 and 4.9 are classified as "light." While they can cause noticeable shaking and light damage is possible in some circumstances, the significant depth of this specific event (nearly 200 km) typically mitigates the impact at the surface. Residents should remain aware of the possibility of aftershocks, which are routine following seismic activity.
