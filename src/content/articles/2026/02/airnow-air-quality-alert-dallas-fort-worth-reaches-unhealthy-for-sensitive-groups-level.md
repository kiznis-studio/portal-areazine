### Current Air Quality

In the Dallas-Fort Worth reporting area, Texas, the air quality index (AQI) has reached a peak of 101 as of February 12, 2026. The primary pollutant of concern is fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which is currently classified in the "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" category. Ozone (O3) levels were also measured at an AQI of 25, which falls into the "Good" category.

### What This Means

An AQI reading of 101 is categorized as "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups." This means that while the general public is not likely to be affected, members of sensitive groups may experience health effects due to the concentration of pollutants in the air.

### Who Should Take Precautions

Groups at increased risk include people with heart or lung disease, older adults, children, and teenagers. These individuals are more sensitive to the effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) than the general population.

### What You Should Do

Members of sensitive groups should consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. It is recommended to take more breaks and engage in less intense outdoor activities. The general public is less likely to be affected and does not need to take special precautions at this AQI level.
