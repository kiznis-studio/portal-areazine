### What Happened
Oshkosh Corporation (Oshkosh Defense) has issued a recall for certain 2025-2026 NGDV vehicles. The recall was initiated because the mounting pin and retaining clip that secure the brake actuator rod to the brake pedal may not have been installed during the manufacturing process.

### Which Products Are Affected
The recall potentially affects 5,242 units. The following models and years are included:
* **2025-2026 OSHKOSH NGDV**
* **2025-2026 OSHKOSH NGDV ELECTRIC**

### What You Should Do
Oshkosh Defense will inspect the brake assembly and install the mounting pin and retaining clip as necessary, free of charge. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed on February 16, 2026. Owners may contact Oshkosh Defense customer service at **1-833-304-8100**. The internal reference number for this recall is **NGDV_TSB_059**.

### Why This Matters
An unsecured brake pedal can separate from the actuator rod while the vehicle is in use. This would cause a complete loss of braking ability, significantly increasing the risk of a crash.
