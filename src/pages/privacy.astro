      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="text-[var(--color-muted)]">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        {SITE_NAME} ("we," "our," or "us") operates the website areazine.com. This Privacy Policy
        explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you visit our site.
        We are committed to respecting your privacy — our site does not use tracking cookies,
        does not require user accounts, and collects minimal data.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>Analytics Data (Anonymized)</h3>
      <p>We use <strong>Umami Analytics</strong>, a privacy-focused, self-hosted analytics service that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does <strong>not</strong> use cookies</li>
        <li>Does <strong>not</strong> track individual users across sessions</li>
        <li>Does <strong>not</strong> collect personal information</li>
        <li>Does <strong>not</strong> share data with third parties</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Aggregated, anonymous metrics we collect include: pages visited, referring website,
        browser type, device category, and country-level location. This data cannot be used
        to identify any individual visitor.
      </p>

      <h3>Error Tracking</h3>
      <p>
        We use <strong>Sentry</strong> to detect and fix technical errors. When an error occurs,
        we may collect error messages, stack traces, browser information, and the page URL.
        This data is used solely to improve site functionality and is automatically deleted
        after 90 days.
      </p>

      <h3>Server Logs</h3>
      <p>
        Our hosting provider (Cloudflare) may collect standard web server logs including IP
        addresses, request timestamps, and URLs accessed. These logs are retained by Cloudflare
        in accordance with their own privacy policy and are used for security and performance purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
        <li>Browsing history beyond our own site</li>
        <li>Location data beyond country level</li>
        <li>Financial or payment information</li>
        <li>Social media profiles or identifiers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        {SITE_NAME} does not require user accounts, login credentials, or any form of registration.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        {SITE_NAME} does not set any first-party cookies. We do not use advertising cookies,
        tracking pixels, or fingerprinting techniques. Your theme preference (light/dark mode)
        is stored in your browser's localStorage, which is not transmitted to our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We use the following third-party services to operate {SITE_NAME}:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> — CDN, DNS, and DDoS protection (<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Umami Analytics</strong> — Privacy-focused, cookie-free analytics (self-hosted, no data shared)</li>
        <li><strong>Sentry</strong> — Error tracking and monitoring (<a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub</strong> — Source code hosting and deployment (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy policy</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We link to official government websites (CPSC, FDA, NHTSA, NOAA, USGS, FEMA) as original
        data sources. These websites have their own privacy policies governed by federal regulations.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        {SITE_NAME} is a general-audience news website not directed at children under 13.
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Because we do not collect personal information, there is typically no personal data to
        access, modify, or delete. However, depending on your jurisdiction (GDPR, CCPA, etc.),
        you may have the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request information about data we hold about you</li>
        <li>Request deletion of any personal data</li>
        <li>Opt out of analytics tracking (our analytics are anonymous by design)</li>
        <li>Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Analytics data is retained in aggregated, anonymized form. Error tracking data in Sentry
        is automatically deleted after 90 days. Server logs are managed by Cloudflare per their
        retention policies.
      </p>

      <h2>International Users</h2>
      <p>
        {SITE_NAME} is operated from within the European Union. Our infrastructure providers
        (Cloudflare, GitHub) may process data in multiple countries. By using our website, you
        acknowledge that your anonymized usage data may be processed outside your country of residence.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page
        with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the website after changes constitutes
        acceptance of the updated policy.
