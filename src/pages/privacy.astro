      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 11, 2026</p>

      <h2>The Short Version</h2>
      <p>
        We don't collect personal data. We don't use cookies. We don't track you.
        We use privacy-focused analytics that respect your anonymity.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We use <strong>Umami Analytics</strong>, a privacy-focused analytics tool, to understand
        how visitors use our site. Umami collects only basic, anonymous information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Page views and referral sources</li>
        <li>Browser type and device category (desktop/mobile/tablet)</li>
        <li>Country and region (based on IP address, not stored)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Umami does not use cookies, does not track individuals across sessions, and does not
        collect or store any personally identifiable information. All data is aggregated and anonymous.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Email addresses or names (unless you email us directly)</li>
        <li>IP addresses or precise location data</li>
        <li>Browsing history or cross-site tracking data</li>
        <li>Cookies or local storage (except for theme preference)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Articles on {SITE_NAME} link to official government websites (CPSC, FDA, NHTSA, NOAA).
        When you click these links, you leave our site and are subject to those sites' privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h2>GDPR & CCPA Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        Because we don't collect personal data, there's nothing to request, delete, or opt out of.
        We are fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations by design.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        If we ever change our privacy practices, we'll update this page with the new date.
        We'll never retroactively change how we handle data—what we didn't collect stays uncollected.
      </p>

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        Email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@areazine.com">privacy@areazine.com</a> if you have
        any questions about this policy.
