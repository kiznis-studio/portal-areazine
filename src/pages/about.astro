        Real-time safety alerts from official U.S. government sources, transformed into clear, actionable news.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Government agencies publish critical safety information every day — product recalls, severe weather alerts,
        earthquake reports, and more. But this data is scattered across multiple federal websites, buried
        in technical formats, and difficult to discover quickly. Areazine aggregates it all into one comprehensive,
        searchable source updated around the clock.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sources</h2>
      <p>Every article on Areazine is derived from official U.S. government data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)</a></strong>
          — Consumer product recalls and safety alerts. Updated every 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="https://open.fda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a></strong>
          — Drug, food, and medical device recalls and enforcement actions. Updated every 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="https://alerts.weather.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a></strong>
          — Severe weather alerts, warnings, and advisories. Updated every hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)</a></strong>
          — Earthquake reports worldwide with magnitude, location, and depth data. Updated every 30 minutes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-muted)]">
        We are actively expanding to include additional sources including FEMA disaster declarations,
        EPA air quality data, and NHTSA vehicle recalls.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>Areazine uses a fully automated pipeline to deliver timely, accurate safety information:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Real-Time Data Collection</strong> — Our systems continuously monitor government APIs,
          fetching new data as frequently as every 30 minutes depending on the source.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI-Powered Article Generation</strong> — We use Google's Gemini AI to transform
          raw government data into clear, readable articles while preserving all factual details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automated Quality Validation</strong> — Every generated article passes through our
          anti-hallucination validation system, which verifies that key facts from the source data
          (product names, dates, locations, magnitudes) appear accurately in the final article.
          Articles that fail validation are rejected and flagged for review.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Instant Publishing</strong> — Validated articles are automatically published to the site,
          and URLs are submitted to search engines via IndexNow for rapid indexing.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Editorial Standards</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Every article links directly to its original government source</li>
        <li>We report facts from official data — we do not editorialize, speculate, or interpret</li>
        <li>Source agency attribution is displayed on every article</li>
        <li>Severity levels (where applicable) are derived from official classifications</li>
        <li>Articles are time-stamped with the original alert issuance time</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Areazine is fully automated. Articles are generated by AI from government data and published
        without manual editorial review, though our quality validation system ensures factual accuracy.
        If you find an error, please let us know and we will correct it promptly.
        The official government source is always the authoritative reference.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
      <p>
        We don't provide professional advice, legal guidance, or medical recommendations.
        Our articles are informational only. For specific concerns about a recall, weather event,
        or earthquake, always consult the official source or appropriate professional.
