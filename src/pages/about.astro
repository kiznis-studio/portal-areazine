      <p class="lead">
        We transform U.S. government public data into clear, readable news that matters to you.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Government agencies publish critical information every day—product recalls, weather alerts,
        safety notices, and more. But this data is often scattered across multiple websites, buried
        in technical documents, or difficult to discover. Areazine brings it all together in one place.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Sources</h2>
      <p>All our articles are based on official data from trusted U.S. government agencies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)</strong> — Product recalls and safety alerts</li>
        <li><strong>Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</strong> — Food, drug, and medical device recalls</li>
        <li><strong>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)</strong> — Vehicle recalls and safety issues</li>
        <li><strong>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</strong> — Weather alerts and forecasts</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Methodology</h2>
      <p>We combine technology and human oversight to deliver accurate, timely information:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Automated Data Collection</strong> — We fetch the latest data from government APIs and databases daily</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Assisted Writing</strong> — We use AI to transform technical data into clear, readable articles</li>
        <li><strong>Human Verification</strong> — Every article is reviewed for accuracy and clarity before publication</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Every article includes a direct link to its original government source. We never
        editorialize or interpret the data—we simply make it more accessible. When in doubt,
        the official government source is always the authoritative reference.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
      <p>
        We don't provide professional advice, legal guidance, or medical recommendations.
        Our articles are informational only. For specific concerns about a recall or safety
        issue, always consult the official source or appropriate professional.
