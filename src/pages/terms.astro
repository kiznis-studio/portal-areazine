      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p class="text-[var(--color-muted)]">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

      <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using {SITE_NAME} (areazine.com), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use.
        If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our website.
      </p>

      <h2>Description of Service</h2>
      <p>
        {SITE_NAME} is an automated news aggregation and summarization service that transforms publicly
        available government data into readable news articles. We aggregate data from official U.S.
        government sources including the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Food and Drug
        Administration (FDA), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), National Oceanic
        and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and Federal Emergency
        Management Agency (FEMA).
      </p>

      <h2>AI-Generated Content Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Articles on {SITE_NAME} are generated using artificial intelligence
        (AI) technology. While every article is based on official government data and undergoes automated
        quality validation, the transformation from raw data to readable article is performed by AI.
        This means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Articles may contain AI-introduced inaccuracies in phrasing, context, or interpretation</li>
        <li>Articles are not written or reviewed by human journalists</li>
        <li>The original government source data is always linked for verification</li>
        <li>Articles should be considered <strong>summaries</strong> of official data, not authoritative reporting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We strongly recommend that readers verify critical safety information by consulting the
        original government source linked at the bottom of every article.
      </p>

      <h2>Not Professional Advice — Not an Emergency Service</h2>
      <p>
        Content on {SITE_NAME} is provided for <strong>general informational purposes only</strong>
        and does not constitute:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Professional medical, legal, financial, or safety advice</li>
        <li>Official government communications or emergency alerts</li>
        <li>A substitute for official recall notices or safety warnings</li>
        <li>Emergency notification or early warning services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>In any emergency, always call 911 or your local emergency number.</strong> Do not
        rely on {SITE_NAME} for emergency information. Our content may be delayed from the original
